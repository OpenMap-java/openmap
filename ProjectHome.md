BBN Technologies' OpenMap TM package is an Open Source JavaBeans TM based programmer's toolkit. Using OpenMap, you can quickly build applications and applets that access data from legacy databases and applications. OpenMap provides the means to allow users to see and manipulate geospatial information. OpenMap is under constant development - the latest version is **OpenMap 5.1.11, released July 20, 2015**.  Note that with v5.0, you need to be using Java 5 or later.  A complete list of updates is maintained in the [CHANGELOG](http://code.google.com/p/openmap/source/browse/CHANGELOG) file in the package.

You can [download](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-Y9CwNIsUOHenpDWGhBSk42b1E&usp=sharing) a copy for free, use it, and make changes to it. Be sure to read the [license](OpenMapLicense.md) before you do.

If you need help, you can post questions on the [Google OpenMap-Users Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openmap-users) forum.
