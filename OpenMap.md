# What is OpenMap? #

OpenMap is a Java Beans based toolkit for building applications and applets needing geographic information. Using OpenMap components, you can access data from legacy applications, in-place, in a distributed setting. At its core, OpenMap is a set of Swing components that understand geographic coordinates. These components help you show map data, and help you handle user input events to manipulate that data.

# What are the license terms for using OpenMap? #

Take a look at the OpenMapLicense. We want you to be able to do pretty much anything with it as long as we get credit for our work and as long as you offer your changes to us so we can possibly add them to the standard version we distribute.

There's much room for improvement of the OpenMap sources. We are interested in any changes you make to the core source, or layers you develop, or other derivative works.
