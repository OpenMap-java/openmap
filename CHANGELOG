	* Tagged OpenMap 5.0.3

	* Added delete() method to FileUtils.

2013-11-24  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* OMGraphic interface has been updated with isRenderable, draw and
	fill methods that take a Shape object as an argument.  The old
	implementation methods are no longer synchronized. For
	BasicGeometry, the getShape() and setShape() methods are
	synchronized and all instances of direct access to the shape
	object have been replaced with calls to these methods.  All render
	methods in OMGraphic implementations have been updated to use one
	getShape() call, and then use that handle to a shape for checks
	and drawing.  This greatly improves rendering performance.  The
	OMList implementations that build a single shape from parts have
	been updated to have more efficient algorithms for building
	shapes.

	* Updated the SimpleAnimationLayer for more control over the
	sprites.  You can set the number of sprites for a batch add, the
	timer was changed to a java.util.Timer that uses a Task for
	updating the sprites.  The GUI was updated to use GridBagLayout
	and has some new controls.  Deleted the
	com.bbn.openmap.graphicLoader.AnimationTester class, it was
	outdated.

	* Updated LayersMenu to use an object lock for the layer with the
	menu entries.

2013-11-12  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Tagged OpenMap 5.0.2

	* Created the MapTileRequester interface, which lets the
	MapTileFactory ask it whether it should keep working.  If
	provided, the StandardMapTileFactory will use the requester as
	tiles are fetched to determine if the tile group fetch is still
	relevant.  The MapTileRequester interface replaces the
	MapTileFactory repaintCallback member variable.

	* Reverted the Geo.intersect method to use the former algorithm.
	The newer algorithm was faulty and broke code.

	* Updated MapTileLayer to implement the mapTile MapTileRequestor
	interface, which also uses the new wrapItUp flag discussed below.
	The repaintCallback repaint() calls made in the MapTileFactory
	were moved back into this layer, using the MapTileRequester
	notifications.

	* Updated layer classes in the com.bbn.openmap.layer.test
	package. The GeoIntersectionLayer was reformatted, and the
	GeoTestLayer was restuctured to use more regular data.

	* Added a boolean flag, wrapItUp, to the OMGraphicHandlerLayer.
	Means something slightly different than interruptable.  WrapItUp
	gets set to true if another SwingWorker is queued to run, due to
	another doPrepare() call or projection change.  If interruptable
	is set to true, the current SwingWorker is killed, and the state
	of some things might be in flux.  If a layer is marked as
	uninterruptable to avoid this state of flux (think loading image
	files), the wrapItUp flag lets the layer decide when to stop
	working if it wishes.

	* Added check to OMScalingRaster for lastProjection, so a clone of
	the projection is only made if it changes.

	* Added threading to FileUtils chooser methods, so if they aren't
	called in the event thread they will still appear.

2013-08-19  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Added the GoogleMapTileFactory as an example of how to extend 
	the MapTileFactory to contact different services.  Added the 
	ability for MapTileLayer to display map data attribution.	

2013-07-27  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Moved default LINETYPE for shape files from GREAT_CIRLCE to
	STRAIGHT.  That should speed things up a bit.

	* Added com.bbn.openmap.layer.learn.SimpleAnimationLayer, a little
	tutorial example of doing animation on OpenMap.  Borrows a lot for
	the AnimationTester, which was also refreshed.

	* Added OMGraphicHandler to the interfaces that
	OMGraphicHandlerLayer implements.  It used to implement that
	interface, and should have been, obviously.

	* Fixed off-by-one errors in the AreaHandler.
	
2013-07-03  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Fixed some JavaDoc errors, added update to Gnomonic Projection.

2013-07-03  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Released OpenMap 5.0.1

2013-06-19  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Added NPE checks to BufferedImageRenderPolicy and OMScalingRaster. 

	* Added width acessors to OMText.  Added Executor methods to
	TaskService to allow customization and control for Layer
	threading.

2013-05-20  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Updates to OMScalingRaster to gracefully handle memory
	exceptions if the scaled image is too big.  Updated javadocs and
	java comments in these classes, added Logger for ScaleFilterLayer.

	* Refactored the LayerHandler so it uses a List<Layer> internally
	to manage Layers. Created the LayerConfigurationListener interface
	and LayerConfigurationListenerSupport object, both of which are
	used by the LayerHandler to pre-notify components when the active
	layers for the application are about to change.  The
	LayerConfigurationListener has the opportunity to make
	modifications to the layer configuration, or change visibility of
	other layers, etc. Added the BasicLayerConfigurationListener, an
	example component that changes the projection of the MapBean to
	CADRG if an RpfLayer is active.

2013-04-13  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Cleaned up debugging.  Updated LOS code API for better control.
	Updated WMSPlugIn setProperties so the current values aren't
	zeroed out of they aren't set.

2013-04-23  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Moved the smarts for zoom levels out of the MapTileMaker class
	and put them in the MapTileCoordinateTransform classes.  Added
	AbstractMapTileCoordinateTransform class to merge similar methods
	and functionality for existing mtct classes.  Updated other
	classes to call mtc functions instead of MapTileMaker static
	functions.

2013-04-16  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Added RelayMapTileSet for MapTileServlet, which fetches tiles
	from a remote server and caches them locally.  Updated
	TerrainLayer to eliminate some verbose error messages.

	* Added Kevin's (kpfarr) fix to RpfTocHandler for merging entry
	coverages properly.

2013-03-02  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Added the ClckOrDrgUndefinedState to the omGraphics.editable
	package, which is now the super class of LineUndefinedState,
	RectUndefinedState and CircleUndefined state.  Lines, Rects and
	Circles can now be defined with a click and mouse move to next
	point, or with a press and drag to the next point, just like
	polys.

2013-03-01  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Fixed the ImageTile outline behavior on projection changes.
	Fixed bug in GeoTIFF code introduced via a FindBugs modification,
	and tweaked the ImageTileLayer GUI to handle list selection
	better.

2013-02-28  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Added some data/vpf vmaplv0 configuration files with more
	instructions on how to use the VPFFeatureLayer.

	* Fixed the VPF attribute fetching with proper indexes.  The VPF
	package api changed in a deep section, to allow the proper feature
	id to be passed to the place where it's needed to fetch
	attributes.

	* Added intersets method to DataBounds.  Can be tested with new
	BoundsTestLayer in layer.test package.

	* Updated SwingWorker and PooledSwingWorker to use FutureTask
	objects, reducing the number of threads that are created.  Updated
	OMGraphicHandlerLayer.workerComplete to take a ISwingWorker in its
	signature.

	* Modified DemoLayer to have separate OMGraphicList for storage,
	loading aux OMGraphicList for painting.
	
2013-02-27  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Made a bunch of adjustments as recommended by FindBug, regarding
	null pointer checks, equality checks, stuff like that.

	* Added AzimuthPanner abstract class with Standard and Shapefile
	subclasses.  This class is used by the PanMouseMode and
	OMMouseMode for panning when the projection is Azimuthal.  The
	modes used to translate the map image, the new class renders
	things instead.  The AzimuthPanner.Standard is used if a shapefile
	for the mousemode is not defined.

	* Modified how the DrawingToolLayer tool buttons react to
	toggling.  Toggling the tool button will deactivate the drawing
	tool, returning mouse control to the application.

	* Updated the mapTile package, allowing the frames to be defined
	by a regex that fits how to ask for tiles from a server or
	directory location.  Locations can include {x}{y}{z} where x,y,z
	are x and y tile coordinates at z zoom level.  This regex can be
	defined as the rootDir of a MapTileLayer.

	* Fixed the BeanBox example, since it was moved.  Updated the
	manifest.txt to remove outdated beans.
	
2012-01-27  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	* Added the maptileservlet package.  This servlet package provide
	map tiles and can be used with the MapTileLayer using the
	ServerMapTileFactory, and can also be easily be used with Leaflet.

	* Misc updates to remove extra semi-colons and fixed some
	compiling warnings.

	* Modified OMArc to take a Point2D object instead of a
	LatLonPoint.  This allows it to be used with the Cartesian
	projection.

	* Modified WholeWorldTileHandler to have more control over how it
	creates jar files holding map tiles.  Can now create specific
	subjars, control whether the master jar gets created, etc.

	* Added TileMillMapTileFactory to
	com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.mapTile package, and also added the
	sqlite jar to the ext directory.  This MapTileFactory can read the
	output tile database files created using the TileMill application.

	* Tweaked the API, got rid of new Grey*TileFactory classes in the
	com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.mapTile package, created new
	TileImagePreparer and added Grey and standard versions of that
	instead.  Now the StandardMapTileFactory and ServerMapTileFactory
	can have different classes handing images, and those classes can
	be swapped at runtime.

	* Fixed build problems when ext directory was missing.

2011-12-23  Knox Rogers  <krogers@Knoxs-MacBook-Pro.local>

	* OpenMap 5.0 released

2011-12-06  dietrick  <dietrick@client.wonkavision.local>

	This entry is a summary of the changes made to OpenMap between the
	4.6.5 release and the 5.0 release.  The API has changed
	significantly for the Projection classes, and that's the main
	reason for the major version change.

	The Projection classes used to translate decimal degree lat/lon
	point objects to java.awt.Point x/y pixel coordinates.  The new
	Projection classes make translations using Point2D objects.
	LatLonPoint has been moved inside the com.bbn.openmap.proj.coords
	package, and now extends Point2D.  The pixel locations returned
	from the Projection are also Point2D objects.  If you've written
	any code that calls Projection methods, you may have to modify
	that code to work with the changes.

	Throughout the code, there have been changes to incorporate
	Generic types, utilizing StringBuilder methods, moving from the
	com.bbn.openmap.util.Debug class to the Java logging mechanism,
	implementing equals() and hashcode() methods.

	OM5 requires the Java 5 runtime.
	
	* com.bbn.openmap

	Updated BufferedMapBean to handle panning better, shifting current
	map image appropriately until the layers react to the projection
	change.
	
	The Layer class has been updated to have a GeoCoordTransformation
	member variable, for data that isn't stored in decimal degree
	lat/lon coordinates.
	
	MapBean updated to have a handle on its ProjectionFactory.
	
	Update the MapHandler class with generified methods.

	Added the notion of isolation to the MapHandlerChild, so it will
	ignore BeanContext events it receives from other BeanContext
	objects that it doesn't know about.
	
	Updated PropertyHandler so it's not tied to the openmap.properties file name.

	* com.bbn.openmap.app

	Added a couple of new application-type classes.  The Main
	application represents the new OpenMap app look, and it utilizes
	the new OverlayMapPanel.

	The TimeFrameApp uses the HotwashPanel and some of the new time
	management components.

	* com.bbn.openmap.app.example

	Moved SimpleMap and SimpleMap2 here.

	* com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.cgm

	Added components that all more sections of the CGM files to be
	read, like constants, colormodel, colortable, marker
	representation and marker size.

	* com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.mapTile

	This new package deals with map image tiles, the kind that are
	used in OpenStreetMap/Google/GDAL tiles, etc.  

	The MapTileFactory classes read tile sets for the MapTileLayer and
	creates images for display on the map.

	The StandardMapTileFactory reads tiles stored locally.

	The ServerMapTileFactory can fetch tiles from a URL (where tiles
	are stored under a root location plus z/x/y.png type location).

	The ServerMapTileFactory will store the images it fetches locally
	to reduce the load on the server.  The
	GreyStandard/ServerMapTileFactory classes convert the images to
	greyscale.

	The EmptyTileHandler classes tell the factory classes how to
	handle missing tiles, whether to do nothing, create new tiles or
	use a default tile to fill the area in.

	The OpenStreetMap tiles are stored a little differently than tiles
	that meet the TileMappingService configuration (like the tiles
	GDAL creates).  You can use the OSMMapTileCoordinateTransform for
	OpenMap/OpenStreetMap tile sets, and the
	TMSMapTileCoordinateTransform for GDAL image tile sets.
	
	The MapTileMaker can create map tile sets from OpenMap layers.
	The MapTileMakerComponent can be added to the OpenMap application
	to visualy define and launch MapTileMaker tile creation.

	* com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.shape

	Added a DbfTableModelFactory class that helps create DbfTableModel
	for an EsriGraphicList when the data is read in.

	Added ShapeGeoIndex, an ExtentIndex implementation created from a
	shape file.  This ExtentIndex can be used with the uses the
	com.bbn.openmap.geo package components to discover intersections
	with other extents (points, paths, regions, etc).
	
	* com.bbn.openmap.event

	Added two new sets of event objects.  Added OMEvent class, which
	is a object representing something that happens at a certain time.
	The OMEvent class is accompanied by the OMEventComparator and
	OMEventHandler, and some other components to aid in selection and
	filtering of OMEvents.  These component tie into the new
	com.bbn.openmap.time components and TemporalOMGraphics.

	Added Undo classes (UndoEvent, UndoStack, UndoStackSupport and
	UndoStackTrigger).  These components are currently used by the
	drawing tool undo/redo capability, but can be used by any
	component that wants to save and restore state.

	Added the OMMouseMode, which is a combination of the PanMouseMode
	and SelectionMouseMode.  The behavior is similar to
	standard/expected web map mouse behavior.

	* com.bbn.openmap.examples

	Removed this package.  The beanbox example is now under
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.beanbox.  hello and crew packages were
	obsolete, and the simple applications have been moved up to app.
	
	* com.bbn.openmap.gui

	Added the OverlayMapPanel, an extension of BasicMapPanel that
	knows how to layer other components with the map so they appear as
	if they are floating on it. The EmbeddedNavPanel and
	EmbeddedScaleDisplayPanel are two components the OverlayMapPanel
	uses.  The DistQuickTool is used by the panel to quickly measure
	distances on the map.

	The HotwashPanel is a new BasicMapPanel that has sliders built
	into it.  It was created to house the new time controls and event
	lists on the bottom and to the left.

	The event subpackage contains components that manage and display
	OMTime events.
	
	* com.bbn.openmap.image.wms incorporated many changes from Tore
	Haslet that added compatibility with WMS 1.3, including
	capabilities queries and projection translations.

	* com.bbn.openmap.layer.event

	Added the EventLayer and supporting components. The EventLayer
	handles TemporalOMGraphics and uses the new com.bbn.openmap.time
	management components.

	* com.bbn.openmap.layer.imageTile

	Added the MapTileLayer.  The layer uses the new
	com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.mapTile components to render
	OpenStreetMap/GDAL/Google map tiles.

	* com.bbn.openmap.layer

	Updated OMGraphicHandlerLayer to utilize the new ISwingWorker classes.

	* com.bbn.openmap.layer.policy

	Added NullProjectionChangePolicy that does nothing when the
	projection changes, and added the PanningImageRenderPolicy, to be
	used by layers that want to redraw what they have when the
	projection changes.  A buffered image is reprojected and reused
	until the layer can update for the new projection.

	* com.bbn.openmap.layer.util

	Added DataPathWanderer class, extending Wanderer, that finds valid
	data paths for a data user.  Base class for creating a data auto-finder.

	* com.bbn.openmap.layer.vpf

	Added VPFFeatureLayer and supporting classes.  This layer uses
	priorty files and GeoSym information/cgm files to order and render
	features from VPF.  New files added to share/data/vpf directory to
	support DNC.

	Added VPFFeatureInfoHandler that lets you get attribute
	information for features.  Configurable via properties. Can be
	extended to display attribute in different ways.  The
	TTFeatureInfoHandler displays attributes in a tooltip.

	* com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics

	The OMGraphics have been updated to double precision.

	OMGraphic is now an interface, with OMGraphicAdapter being the base class.

	DrawingAttributes have new transfer methods that make it easier to
	clone and copy settings.  Added Builder class to make it easier to
	make it more convenient to create and make settings on a new
	instance.

	Added GraphicUndefinedEditState to the editable subpackage, for
	OMGraphics in the process of being defined by the drawing tool.
	It's a state that defines when an OMGraphic is only partially
	defined.

	OMGraphicList and OMGeometryList extend OMList, which itself
	implements the List interface.  They are now iterable, and use
	Generic Types to define what is held in them.

	Added OMWarpingImage, which is a raster OMGraphicClass that warps
	its image to the current OpenMap projection (during generate).

	Added the time subpackage, which defines interfaces for OMGraphics
	that change over time.  TemporalOMPoint and TemporalOMScalingIcon
	are two implementations of that interface.

	Added ImageWarp class to the util subpackage, which does the
	heaving lifting work of the OMWarpingImage.

	Added RibbonMaker class to the util subpackage, which creates a
	buffer area around a vector shape.
	
	* com.bbn.openmap.proj

	The proj package classes have undergone a significant API change,
	as described in the summary above.  For the top-level Proj class
	and Projection interface, the Point references for projected
	locations have been replaced with Point2D objects.  The
	LatLonPoint references have been replaced with Point2D references.
	The old projection classes now extend the GeoProj class, and the
	Point2D objects meant to indicate latitude/longitude points are
	LatLonPoints.

	There is a Cartesian projection for standard X/Y drawing.  You can
	use the OMShape object for drawing things in a Cartiesian
	projection.  Other OMGraphics will work too, but the lat/lon
	coordinates are interpreted as x/y coordinates.
	
	Deleted the ProjectionFactoryLoader and the View classes. The
	ProjectionFactory is no longer a singleton, there's a different
	ProjectionFactory for each MapBean, and each MapBean can have a
	different set of Projections it can handle.

	* com.bbn.openmap.proj.coords

	All of the coordinate point classes and methods have been moved
	here, including LatLonPoint and VHTransform.  Updates to GCT
	classes.

	LatLonPoint was rewritten to inherit from Point2D, and is modeled
	after that class with Float and Double implementations.  Note that
	overridden Point2D methods have (x,y) signatures, while
	LatLonPoint.setLocation(lat, lon) methods have (y, x) signatures.
	
	* com.bbn.openmap.time

	Created new time package, moved older time components here just to
	make them more application-friendly.  Added components that
	understand the notion of time bounds and managing the notion of a
	point in time.

	* com.bbn.openmap.tools.drawing

	Updated OMDrawingTool to use UndoStack and triggers to handle edit
	undos and redos.

	* com.bbn.openmap.tools.symbology.milStd2525

	Added SVGSourceFileReorganizer, a class that takes the
	distribution package from DISA and flattens the files out into a
	target directory, renaming them as needed for the
	SymbolReferenceLibrary.
	
	* com.bbn.openmap.util package

	Added AbstractXMLParser class, a base class for XML parsing, wraps
	the DefaultHandler java class.

	Added Attributable interface, describing classes that can handle
	an attribute map.

	Added ClasspathHacker, which adds jars to classpath at runtime.

	Added MGRSCoordInfoFormatter, which formats coordinates into MGRS format.

	DataBounds updated to use Point2D objects, add method added.
	
	Added DeepCopyUtil, which handles cloning propery.  OMGraphics updated to use it.

	FileUtils updated to have new zip writing algorithm, methods.

	Added HashCodeUtil to assist in creating proper hash code values.

	Added ISwingWorker interface and updated OMGraphicHandlerLayer to
	use it, so other implementions could be used in the layer. Added
	PooledSwingWorker, implementing a reuseable SwingWorker. Added
	TaskService to manage SwingWorkers.

	PropUtils added methods to create objects from property
	list (standard openmap.properties paradigm).  parseColor method
	returns a Paint object instead of a Color object.

	Updated Wanderer class to be able to handle exhaustive and
	non-exhaustive searches.

	Moved former com.bbn.openmap.layer.util.http/html/stateMachine
	packages to this util package.
	
2009-03-26  Don Dietrick  <dietrick@dhcp89-073-115.bbn.com>

	* Refined the DTED packages, removing duplicate classes in
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.dted and having those classes refer to the
	com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.dted package contents.  The
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.dted.DTEDFrame has been changed to
	DTEDSubframedFrame, and now extends the DTEDFrame class in
	dataAccess.dted.  The DTEDLayer is the main class in
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.dted, and those classes use the
	DTEDSubframedFrame.  The
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.dted.DTEDFrameCacheLayer uses the classes in
	the com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.dted package.  The choice between
	the two is memory usage (when DTED is used by other components it
	can also be used by DTEDFrameCacheLayer) vs
	speed (the DTEDLayer is faster).

2009-03-24  Don Dietrick  <dietrick@dhcp89-073-115.bbn.com>

	* Added com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics.util.ImageWarp, which takes an
	image file and warps it to fit a given projection.  Can be created
	with a image path or BufferedImage, takes a DataBounds or
	WorldFile object to specify where the image is, and also takes a
	GeoCoordsTransformation to handle preprojected images.  Also added
	the com.bbn.openmap.omGraphic.OMWarpingImage that wraps around an
	ImageWarp object to display the image on the map as an OMGraphic.
	
	* Modified the DataBounds object to provide height and width
	calculations (deltas between max and mix), and can also have an
	internal DataBounds object that serves as hard limits for added
	values.  The hard limits override any point values that may be
	added.

	* Simplified the OMApplet.html file, with simple APPLET tags.
	
	* Removed com.bbn.openmap.LatLonPoint.  The
	com.bbn.openmap.proj.coords.LatLonPoint is the class to use now.

	* Fixed problem where the ProjectionSupport thread continued to
	run, preventing garbage collection of the MapPanel and all its
	contents.  That thread gets interrupted when the MapBean is
	disposed.  Added dispose() methods on MapPanel, MapBean,
	ProjectionSupport, OpenMapFrame that release objects. Dispose
	should be called on the MapHandler, and when OMComponents detect
	they have been removed from the MapHandler in their findAndUndo
	method, they should call dispose() on themselves if they have that
	method.

	* The ProjectionFactory is no longer a singleton.  A
	ProjectionFactory is expected to be placed in a MapHandler, where
	it will attach itself to the MapBean and can be accessed through
	the MapBean.  If a ProjectionFactory is not set and requested from
	the MapBean, the MapBean will create a ProjectionFactory with the
	default set of ProjectionLoaders.  The ProjectionFactoryLoader
	class has been removed, and that functionality (creating
	ProjectionLoaders from Properties) has been incorporated into the
	ProjectionFactory.  The ProjectionFactory should be created like
	any other component added to the MapHandler, via the properties or
	programmatically added to the MapHandler.

2009-03-14  Don Dietrick  <dietrick@wonkavision.local>

	* OpenMap 5.0 released as beta via SVN repository. All further
	changes will apply to version 5.0.  OpenMap 5.0 requires Java 5
	(jre 1.5.x).

	* The com.bbn.openmap.proj.coords.LatLonPoint has been created
	and it extends java.awt.Point2D.  You can instantiate
	LatLonPoint.Double and LatLonPoint.Float classes, just like
	Point2D.  Note that the Point2D methods follow the x, y ordering
	of arguments, but that the setLocation() methods of LatLonPoint
	follow the lat, lon ordering.  The old LatLonPoint currently
	extends the new LatLonPoint.Float object.

	* The Proj/Projection class and interface are now based on
	java.awt.Point2D objects. The GeoProj class extends Projection,
	and Point2D objects in coordinate space are now LatLonPoints as
	allowed with Generics.  The Cartesian projection handles projected
	data.

	* The OMShape object is added to handle cartesian shapes, taking
	java.awt.Shape objects and managed as an OMGraphic.
	
2009-03-05  Don Dietrick  <dietrick@wonkavision.local>

	* OpenMap 4.6.5 released.
	
2009-02-27  Don Dietrick  <dietrick@wonkavision.local>

	* The CSVTokenizer was updated to properly handle empty fields in
	front and end of lines.

	* The projection package was updated with the DatumShiftProjection
	which wraps projections to provide datum shifting.  The
	CoordinateReferenceSystem has been updated to use new
	GeoCoordTransformation objects for different projection types.

	* For OMGraphics, the EditableOMPoly, OMGraphicList and OMText all
	had minor bug fixes.  Polygons are now re-editable after colors
	are modified, OMGraphicLists had selection problems patched, and
	OMText FontSizer setter was fixed.

	* MapHandler was modified with an overriding remove method that
	also checks to see if an object being removed was a
	BeanContextMembershipListener.  The parent class was adding such
	objects to a special list when they were added, but not removing
	them from that list when they were removed from the context.  This
	was causing a memory leak of sorts.

	* Added MapBean.dispose() method, which cleans up the projection
	support thread and releases lingering handles on layer objects.
	ProjectionSupport also has dispose() method that is called to
	clean up.

	* Layer.setProperties() functionality was broken out to a
	setLayerProperties() method so subclasses could override
	setProperties() and still get to to the superclass functionality
	if desired.

	* Updated the ShapeLayer and package.  The SpatialIndex no longer
	needs to be defined, it will be found or made next to the shape
	file.  The dbf file will automatically be used if found, and the
	DbfFile rule handling was improved.  All of the various Shape
	layers in the com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape package were update to
	work using the same EsriGraphicFactory mechanisms.

	* BinaryFile modified with improved name handling for
	FileInputReader, separating absolute path and file name queries.
	ByteArrayInputReader added to allow BinaryFile to contain entire
	file in memory.

	* WMS package updated to have capabilies query handling, improved
	layer control and new SRS handling. The WMSPlugIn was updated to
	WMS version 1.1.1 and has better query handling.

	* Added method to ConvexHull to allow for tolerances when trying
	to determine equal points to reduce the number of unnecessary
	points in the resulting polygon.

	* Added the CoordInfoFormatter and CoordInfoFormatHandler to make
	it easier to define how coordinates were displayed in the
	InformationDelegator from CoordMouseModes.

	* Updated dbf attribute type handing and handling of null cells.
	Padding with spaces instead of null characters.

2008-02-29  Don Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* OpenMap 4.6.4 released.

2008-02-27  Don Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Updated the PropertyHandler to have its own property prefix.  This 
	property prefix is used by the PropertyHandler when it looks for a 
	properties file, and when it looks inside the properties file for 
	application level properties, like the components list, include 
	files, and the configuration directory.  Where the PropertyHandler
	used to only be able to look for an openmap.properties file that 
	contained an openmap.components property, you can now define a 
	different prefix for the file and property.
	
	* The com.bbn.openmap.util.propertyEditor.Inspector was updated to
	provide a simple GUI that can be inserted on behalf of a
	PropertyConsumer, without providing window controls, etc.  It can
	be used just to provide the widgets for the PropertyConsumer
	adjustments.

	The DrawingAttributesPropertyEditor was created as an example of
	creating a property editor widget that can control multiple
	properties in a single GUI widget.
	
	* The com.bbn.openmap.util.cacheHandler package was added,
	allowing for a more generic caching mechanism than was provided by
	the com.bbn.openmap.layer.util.cacheHandler package.
	
	* The GeoCoordTransformation interface was added, providing a
	mechanism that allows transformations from pre-projected
	coordinates into lat/lon space.  The
	com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.shape classes can use the
	GeoCoordTransformation objects in order to display pre-projected
	shape data.  Several GCTs have been implemented, including
	LatLonGCT, MercatorGCT, UTMGCT.  A CoordinateReferenceSystem
	object also uses the GCTs, and assists the WMS server code in
	handling requests.

	The MGRSPoint was updated to handle zone letters correctly,
	instead of defaulting to UTM values.
	
	* UTMProjection added.
	
	* OMGraphic improvements:

	- OMEllipses with XY and OFFSET rendertypes were added.
	- OMGraphicHash was added.
	- OMTextLabeler was updated to handle different anchor locations.
	- OMPoint.Image class was added, an OMPoint that uses an Image to
	mark the location.  The image does not change size with respect to
	map scale, as the OMScalingIcon does.
	- OMGraphicList findAll() method fixed when inner vague lists were
	used.
	- The EditableOMGraphic GUIs for Text and Range Rings were updated
	to have better persistence across different OMGraphics.
	- The DrawingAttributes GUI, including the color settings, was
	moved into the pop-up menu, replacing all of the buttons.  Just
	the stroke button remains, and the colors on that button adjust
	according to the DrawingAttributes settings.

	* The DrawingToolLauncher GUI was updated to handle the
	DrawingAttributes GUI changes.

	* The VPFConfig class was modified to maintain knowledge of
	current features set on a VPFLayer that it is modifying.

	* The RPF Layer code was improved.  The RPFCacheHandler was
	modified to reduce the number of bytes utilized in the cache
	tracking mechanism, which greatly decreases memory usage for large
	datasets.  The RPFFrameEntry was modified to use fewer bytes for
	file name storage, also saving memory for large datasets.

	The RPFLayer was modified to use the OMGraphicHandlerLayer's
	transparency mechanism, replacing the colortable mechanism that
	was in place.

	* The Link Protocol has been updated to version 0.5, with a
	greatly reduced transmission footprint by making all of the field
	headers one or two characters long.  A cache mechanism was added
	to the protocol and on the client Java code that allows values
	sent previously to be reused for later graphics.

	* Added com.bbn.openmap.layer.learn package, to hold layers that
	serve as examples for specific capabilities.  BasicLayer and
	InteractionLayer added.

	* OMGraphicHandlerLayer has improved SwingWorker threading
	support, including the interruption mechanism and thread locking.
	Transparency can now be set on any OMGraphicHandlerLayer, and
	there is a GUI widget available that can be added to any palette.

	* The DrawingToolLayer has improved file support, including
	reading from multiple shape files to reproduce previous savings.

	* The DeclutterMatrix has improved access to a java.awt.Graphics
	object that prevents locking during multi-threaded access.

	* The com.bbn.openmap.io.FileInputReader handles reopening files
	that have been closed.  The BinaryFile and BinaryBufferedFile can
	now read unsigned shorts upon request.

	* The com.bbn.openmap.image.wms package adds much better WMS
	support, including handling GetCapabilities requests.

	* The com.bbn.openmap.image.ImageScaler class was added, providing
	better image scaling performance in the AbstractImageFormatter and
	OMScalingRasters.

	ImageFormatters now provide their content type for web delivery.

	The ColorReducer class provides support for color reduction in
	images, and the PNG32ImageFormatter and PNG8ImageFormatter was
	added.

	The WMS servlet was updated to handle the new web mapping server
	support code.

	* WindowSupport windows no longer shrink when it they are
	repeatedly brought up.  This fix affects the OverviewMapHandler,
	LayersPanel, CoordPanel, Layer palettes, etc.

	* The CoordPanel was updated to use WindowSupport, replacing the
	CoordDialog and CoordInternalFrame.

	* The new GeoArray object was created to improve memory management
	and performance for the com.bbn.openmap.geo package components.
	The ConvexHull and RadialRegion classes were also added to the
	package.

	* The ProjectionSupport threading model was improved, adding a
	more robust threading lock mechanism during projection change
	notifications.

	* The PanMouseMode image management and projection handling was
	improved.

	* The AbstractMouseMode (affecting all mouse modes) has better
	support for defining custom cursors and icons.  Support for
	specifying the zoom direction to mouse wheel relationship was
	added.

	* The com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.shape package was updated to add
	support for all Shape types.  The EsriGraphicFactory class now
	creates EsriGraphics from files and streams, and both the
	com.bbn.openmap.plugin.esri and com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape
	componets use this com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.shape package.  The
	DbfFile class was created to allow better handling of dbf files,
	providing a way to limit what fields are read out of a file and
	kept in memory.  The DbfHandler class was created to manage
	EsriGraphics and their rendering attributes/labels/tooltips/info
	based on the dbf file contents.  The DbfHandler class lets you set
	rules for dbf file contents so you can draw map objects different
	based on attribute values.  The ShapeLayer was updated to use this
	class.

	* iso8211 package had some bug fixes related to the DDFSubfields
	and definitions.

	* MapBean was updated to support ProjectionChangeVetoExceptions,
	so that layers or other components can now limit what a projection
	can change to.

	* LayerHandler can now have it's own prefix to be used to define
	layers in the properties file.  Previously, the LayerHandler
	looked for an 'openmap.layers' property for its layer list.  While
	'openmap.layers' still works, it now looks for a
	'<markername>.layers' property first, where <markername> is the
	keyword used to define the LayerHandler object instance in the
	'openmap.components' property, or whatever Property prefix the
	LayerHandler is given in the setProperties(...) method.

	The LayerHandler was also updated to handle background layers
	better, so that background layers show up at the bottom of layer
	lists.

	* Layer has hasGUI() can let component know if a GUI is available.
	The LayerPanels use this to disable their palette icons if a GUI
	is not available for a particular layer.

	* LatLonPoint has been updated to contain many more functions to
	assist with determining relationships with other
	LatLonPoints (distance, etc).

	* Added I18 supports for many more GUI components.  This effort is
	continuing.

	* Added support for GeoTIFF and geocoded images via the
	com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.image package. This support is for
	images that are in a equal-arc WGS84 decimal degree projection.
	Relies on the JAI package being available on the host system.  The
	ImageTile class is a subclass of OMScalingRaster that handles the
	display of these files. GeoTIFFs with embedded projection
	information are handled, as well as other image formats with world
	files. The com.bbn.openmap.layer.imageTile.ImageTileLayer is a
	layer that handles the display of ImageTiles, and serves as an
	example of how to use the new com.bbbn.openmap.dataAccess.image
	package.

2006-02-14  Don Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Updated LayerHandler to manage layers in the MapHandler better.
	Layers will only be added to the MapHandler if they don't know
	about it already.  Also, calling LayerHandler.init(Layer[]) has
	been updated to check to see if Layers are removable, and honors
	that setting.  Non-removable layers will be added to the bottom of
	the layer stack as the new layers are added.  These layers will
	also be added to the MapHandler as needed, where they previously
	weren't.  This fixes the bug where layers added to the application
	as a result of loading a new properties file weren't being added
	to the MapHandler.

	* Updated BeanContextPlugIn to remove itself from the
	BeanContext/MapHandler when it sees its own PlugIn layer being
	removed.  Made EsriPlugIn extend BeanContextPlugIn instead of
	AbstractPlugIn.  Cleaned up how DataBoundsProviders were handled
	as they were removed from the MapHandler.  PlugIns weren't being
	removed properly.
	
	* Added an attribute Hashtable to Layer.

	* Updated the MapRequestHandler and ImageServer classes to handle
	background Paints better.  Map requests coming through the
	MapRequestHandler no longer set the default background color, and
	the ImageServer API has createImage(...) methods added to allow
	the passing in of background Paint objects to be used for an
	image.  The background color can be set in the properties.

	* Updated WindowSupport to have WSDisplay inner classes that
	handle the differences between showing components in JFrames,
	JDialogs and JInternalFrames.  Components can specify which kind
	of WSDisplay they wish to use when the create their WindowSupport
	object, or they can let the WindowSupport object create the
	default version for them.  If the Environment.useInternalFrames
	flag is set, then JDialogs will be used for components that don't
	specify which WSDisplays to use.  If the Environment flag is not
	set, then the WindowSupport.defaultWindowSupportDisplayType static
	member variable dictates what kind of window will be created.
	Although the JFrame class is the default, there are accessors to
	change that setting (WindowSupport.Frm.class,
	WindowSupport.Dlg.class or WindowSupport.IntrnlFrm.class) 
	to suit your application.

2006-02-01 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>
	* OpenMap 4.6.3 released.

2006-01-24  Don Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Updated the ElevationBandGenerator in the
	com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics.grid package, adding the loader and
	ColorGeneratorLoader for it.

	* Updated the CSVTiledImagePlugIn to use
	FileCacheImageInputStreams to create BufferedImages, instead of
	ImageIcons.  This is in an effort to reduce memory usage for tiled
	images.

	* Updated the com.bbn.openmap.util.FileUtils object for better
	options presented to the user, as well as methods that copy files
	and zip/unzip files.

	* Updated the Directory and File property editors to provide
	better control over the options offered to the user.

	* Added com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics.OMAbstractLine, which is now
	the superclass of OMLine and OMPoly.  Arrowheads were moved up to
	this class, so polylines can now have arrowheads attached.
	There's an editable version as well.

	* EditableOMRangeRings were updated to estimate how may rings they
	should have when changing units in the GUI.  It used to maintain
	the number it had, which could result in it being overwhelmed with
	the new settings.  Now it behaves as expected.

	* Added bold and italic buttons to EditableOMText GUI.

	* OMArrowHead was updated to allow more parameters to be chosen by
	subclasses, making it easier to customize.

	* Updated the OMGraphic serialization methods to handle strokes
	better.

	* OMGraphicList.findAll(...) method lets you give an x,y pixel point on
	the map, and retrieve all of the OMGraphics under that point
	within the provided pixel range.

	* Added a Text Matte Color and Stroke, which, if set, will outline
	the text characters with a matting rendered with that stroke.

	* Updated the com.bbn.openmap.layer.vpf.VMAP2Shape class to use
	the com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.shape components to create shape
	files.
	
	* Set LayerUtils to be deprecated, you should use PropUtils
	instead.  The OpenMap components have been so updated.  PropUtils
	was updated to have all the same methods as LayerUtils did, with
	some new ones including one that will set the proper
	internationalized strings (setI18NPropertyInfo(...)) for the
	getPropertyInfo() call of a PropertyConsumer.
	
	* Added the RpfUtil class, which allows you to modify
	(copy/delete/move) RPF data from RPF directories with filters that
	let you specify scale, chart type, or location.

	* Added Composites to the RenderPolicy API in
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.policy.  This allows the addition of
	Composites to be added to a render policy to modify the rendering
	process for that layer.  You can add an AlphaComposite to a layer
	this way in order to get it rendered with transparency.

	* Updated AbstractLocationHandler to hold DrawingAttributes object
	for names and location markers, instead of just holding a Color
	for each.  The Property GUI hasn't been updated yet, so the old
	Color GUI still works.  Added LocationHandler.NamePropertyPrefix
	and LocationHandler.LocationPropertyPrefix to allow scoping for
	properties.

	"Fixed" the CSVLinkHandler, meaning that it works, but still needs
	more work to be fully functional with property settings and
	different rendering effects for lines and endpoints.

	Updated CSVLocationHandler to have methods that can be overridden
	when dealing with tokens and newly read info from the CSV file.
	
	* Updated the DTEDLayer minScale property code to set the new
	Layer maxScale member variable, keeping with the meaning of the
	Layer's version.  Removed the DTEDLayer's minScale property and
	supporting methods.

	* Added OMGraphicHandlerLayer.createLayerWorker() method to make
	it easier to override and set customized LayerWorkers (threading
	mechanism for layer work).

	* Removed restriction from BinaryFile that caused it to check for
	an "http://" lead on URLs.

	* Added the MagicPlanetImageComponent to the com.bbn.openmap.image
	package.  The MagicPlanet is a spherical display system (get more
	information at http://www.globalimagination.com).  By adding this
	component to an OpenMap application, images suitable for display
	on the MagicPlanet can be created, at varing intervals and
	resolution settings.  The MagicPlanet's StoryTeller software can
	then be told where the images are stored, and can then manage the
	images.
	
	* Updated the AbstractImageFormatter to reset an existing
	projection back on a layer after the formatter has used it to
	create a image.  This should help for situations where an active
	map window wasn't behaving properly after being saved to a file.
	Removed the AcmeJPEG* code, it didn't work and the Sun version
	should be used instead.

	* Updated the ScenarioGraphicLoader so that the mode settings are
	more obvious, instead of being changing depending on the clock
	setting.

	* Updated the com.bbn.openmap.geo package, which now has the
	capability to do spatial intersection and proximity analysis in
	lat/lon space.  The ExtentIndex (and ExtentIndexImpl) contain
	collections of GeoExtents which may be queried for intersection by
	other GeoExtents.  The Ribbon object is an attempt at rendering
	spatial areas around GeoExtents.

	The com.bbn.openmap.layer.test.GeoIntersectionLayer is an example
	of how to use the ExtentIndex.  That layer loads shape files into
	the ExtentIndex, and then lets you draw on the map to test how the
	drawn objects intersect with the shape file objects.  

2006-01-23  Don Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Updated the com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.shape package so its
	components use the attributes of OMGraphics instead of using the
	OMGraphic appObject directly.  The DbfTableModel might be stored
	in the EsriGraphicList's DBF_ATTRIBUTE key.  In each of the
	EsriGraphics, the index is stored under that EsriGraphic's
	SHAPE_INDEX_ATTRIBUTE.  Updated DBF output to put numbers in
	English locale number format.
	
	* Added the DTEDFrameACC object to the
	com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.dted package and DTEDFrame, to hold
	DTED accuracy attribute information.  This class was submitted by
	Matt Revelle.
	
	* Made the MouseModes MouseWheelListeners, and made the default
	action for the OpenMap MapMouseModes to control zooming over the
	map.
	
	* Added minScale and maxScale properties for layers, which hold
	onto scale settings that the layer can use to determine if it
	should react to a projection or not.  Also added an Icon member
	variable to the Layer.  Note that the Layer doesn't actually use
	the minScale and maxScale parameters, that's up to the Layer
	subclass authors.

	* Removed Makefiles, now that ant is the official build mechanism.

2005-05-24  Don Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Refactored the FilePropertyEditor so it includes an uneditable
	text area, and added callback methods for settings that all the
	other file-related PropertyEditors use now.  Justified the
	ColorPropertyEditor and choice PropertyEditor widgets to the left
	instead of centered.

2005-05-23  Don Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* ComponentFactory updated to contain a singleton instance, and
	the static methods have been updated to use that singleton
	instance.  This makes it possible to change the behavior of the
	ComponentFactory by setting a subclass as the singleton.  The
	PropUtils.createObjectFromProperties(...) method now calls the
	ComponentFactory.create(...) method.

	* Fixed the BasicGeometry attribute handling where the first
	attribute being set was being stomped on and deleted when
	subsequent attributes were added.

	* Updated DrawingAttributes so it doesn't create a
	BasicStrokeEditor when the stroke is being set, for those times
	when a display is not available.  Property output for colors now
	in hex strings.  OMGraphic uses static BASIC_STROKE object for
	default strokes, instead of creating new object.

	* Updated VPF FeatureDrawingAttributes to set String constants
	when display type is set, added null checks when GUI is reset.
	Fixed problem for initial settings for attribute display via
	properties file.

	* Added null check in ESRIPolygonRecor/ESRIPointRectord for
	DrawingAttributes being set, made SpatialIndex a Closable object.
	Added the connectParts() call to OMAreaList for handing holes, but
	that code section still isn't active by default due to problems
	with OMAreaList and very large objects.

	* Updated MIFLayer to be able to read files specified as
	resources, files or URLs.

	* Updated Location object to have more specific
	shouldRenderName(...) and shouldRenderLocation(...) methods, these
	methods make it easier for subclasses to determine/control when
	those parts should be drawn.
	
	* Updated the DrawingToolLayer to have an option-filled GUI that
	allows the saving and loading of a serialized OMGraphicList
	to/from a file, as well as saving the properties for the layer.
	Shape layer creation is also an option.

	* Updated the layer ordering in the Crew and SimpleMap2 examples.

	* Updated DTEDFrame and RpfFrame to call close on its file handle.

	* Updated InformationDelegator to use the Environment Desktop for
	internal frames.

2005-02-15  Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Released OpenMap 4.6.2
	
2005-02-15  Donald Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the cntry02 world boundary shape files to the package and
	made them the default files used in the OpenMap application.
	They're bigger files, and the application runs a little slower,
	but they are much more accurate than the dcwpo-browse files.  The
	dcwpo-browse files are still available if the old data is desired.

2005-02-11  Donald Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Updated many classes for internationalization, with help from
	Piotr Kaminski and Jesper Berglund.

	* Updated the RpfLayer so the opaque slider works on the coverage
	rectangles as well as the images.  Updated the palette to enable
	the modification of preference settings.  Updated the MakeToc to
	better check for non-RPF image files to skip them when appropriate.

	* Updated FileUtils to have separate save and open methods,
	updated different classes in the package to call them
	appropriately.

	* Updated the BasicI8n class so it can provide a set of
	ResourceBundle properties files that can be used to
	internationalize an application.  If the 'i18n.create' Debug flag
	is set (with a -Ddebug.i18n.create OpenMap application flag, or
	by calling Debug.put("i18n.create") somewhere at the very
	beginning of an application), the BasicI18n class will log all
	the resource bundle properties files accessed or attempted to be
	accessed, and will track the retrieved strings or their defaults
	provided to the application GUI.  If requested, the BasicI8n
	class can create a hierarchy of I18N_<locale>.properties files in
	the correct directory structure of the requesting application,
	filled with key-value pairs where the values can be replaced with
	language-appropriate translations for the given locale.  If the
	application is run with the 'i18n.default' flag also set, then
	I18N.properties files will be created without the locale
	setting. Added the I18nFileCreateMenuItem that will tell the
	BasicI18n class to create the new files.  The openmap.properties
	file was updated to show how to load the menu item to a generic
	OMBasicMenu in order to temporarily add this class.

2005-01-10  Donald Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Updated the com.bbn.openmap.tools.symbology.milStd2525
	package, specifically, the SymbolReferenceLibrary and the
	SymbolChooser, which can now create icon symbols given the
	proper data source.  The SymbolChooser now updates the symbol
	code based on option settings, and the SymbolReferenceLibrary
	uses a SymbolImageMaker to decide how to make a image based on
	that code.  The SVGSymbolImageMaker can use the SVG symbol
	library available from DISA, and also requires the Batik
	package from http://xml.apache.org/batik.  The
	PNGSymbolImageMaker and GIFSymbolImageMaker
	will create scaled icons from a gif file selection.

	* Added labeling capabilties to OMGraphics, handled by their
	attribute capabilities.  If the OMGraphicConstants.LABEL attribute
	is set with an OMLabel object (the OMTextLabel is one
	implementation), labels will appear on the map for an OMGraphic.
	Added OMGraphicConstants.TOOLTIP and OMGraphicConstants.INFOLINE
	constants, too, that can be used by layers to look up these kind
	of attributes in an OMGraphic.  The VPFLayer now looks for these
	attributes for it's display.

	* Updated the StandardMapMouseInterpreter to handle right mouse
	button clicks better, by trapping the popup trigger.

	* Updated VPF package components to provide access to feature
	attribute information, which can be displayed via tooltip,
	information line, or label on the map.  The choice of display
	type and attribute type can be specified in the layer's palette
	and/or properties.  The VPFLayer's 'searchByFeatures' property
	must be set to true for this capability.

	* Added ImageIOFormatter class, a super class for creating image
	files via the java imageio package.  Added GIF and PNG
	implementations.
	
	* Moved the LayerHandler threading support to the LayerSupport
	object that also performs some queueing capability, so that the
	threads lauched form layers changes are performed in order to
	preserve stability.

2004-11-25  Donald Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Modified the ProjectionSupport and LayerHandler to launch
	threads for projection notifications to the layers and for layer
	reordering, to prevent the application from getting hung up for
	some of the more extensive notification event reactions.

	* Updated VMAP2Shape to use EsriShapeExport class, instead of
	using the Shape package stuff.  Updated VPFConfig to check for
	 backslashes and replace them with Java-friendly forward slashes.

	* Modified the ESRIPolygonRecord to include the donated code to
	handle polygon holes using OMAreaList.  This code is disabled,
	however, because OMAreaList doesn't really handle shapes that go
	around the earth yet, and having this modification breaks
	world-level shapefile display.  OMAreaList needs to be fixed
	before this code is enabled full-time.

	* Updated BasicGeometry to have the option of connecting shapes
	that are appended, instead of automatically not doing that.
	Updated OMAreaList to make that BasicGeometry append call with
	the connect parameter.

2004-11-01  Donald Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Released OpenMap 4.6.1

2004-10-15  Donald Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Changed OMGrid to extend OMGraphicList instead of OMGraphic.
	This provides better access to the OMGraphics that the
	OMGridGenerator creates.  If that access is not wanted, just set
	the OMGrid (OMGraphicList) to be vague.

2004-10-05  Donald Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Updated the SwingWorker to match the latest version from Sun.

	* Added LambertConformalConic projection, along with it's loader
	that has properties to let it describe the LCC attributes it will
	create.  You create a loader in the properties for a specific
	state plane or other LCC definition, and that shows up as an
	option to the ProjectionFactory.

	* Updated the decorated OMGraphic parts, adding a circle
	decoration and some weather notations.  Added editable
	OMScalingRaster code, submitted by Dan Bitts.  Fixed FontSizer.
	Added callouts to FilterSupport to handle actions on OMGraphics
	that pass and fail the filter.  Fixed transparency handling in
	OMRaster. Updated rotation handling in OMRasterObject.  Added
	accessors to OMScalingRaster to get display corners.  Updated
	OMText so rotated text factored into distance() correctly.	

	* Modified LayerHandler to add layers to top of stack, if their
	position is undefined.

	* Update VPF components.  Added feature type sublists to
	warehouse support, to better control display of different feature
	types.
	
	* Fixed MakeToc from the RPF package, it was writing bad A.TOC
	files.  Updated RPF coverage tools.  Modified RpfFrame to check
	for lower case file names if upper case isn't found, and also to
	check for full pathnames when the frame is actually loaded,
	instead of when the layer was created, which was really expensive.
		
	* Modifed BufferedImageRenderPolicy to extend
	RenderingHintsRenderPolicy, so buffered image could be
	anti-aliased if needed.

	* Modified how the OMGraphicHandlerLayer handles/locks the
	SwingWorker during updates, and how it cleans up if the
	SwingWorker gets interrupted.  Removed synchronization notation
	from some methods.  Added new GRP capability to handle events
	over the map.

	* Fixed Location bug with label rendering.

	* Modified DTEDCoverageLayer to extend OMGraphicHandlerLayer.

	* Updated BufferedLayer to properly handle BeanContext with its
	sub-layers, as well as responding to getProperties().  Updated
	ScaleFilterLayer as well.

	* Added methods to LatLonPoint that call GreatCircle class to
	calculate distance/azimuth to another LatLonPoint, or to find a
	LatLonPont a distance and azimuth away from the current point.

	* Updated the LayersPanel initialization with the
	LayerControlButtonPanel.

	* Added method to ProjectionFactory to let it provide the default
	projection set with the Environment projection parameters.
	Updated the BasicMapPanel and ImageServer/MapRequestHandler to
	use that method.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.util.FileUtils class that has a
	static method for asking for a file from the user, using a JFileChooser.

	* Added a save capability
	com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.shape.DbfTableModel when it's run
	directly on a .dbf file.  The save option was also added, enabled
	with a behavior mask setting.

	* Updated the com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.dted components to be
	able to handle .dt2 files.

2004-05-24  Donald Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the OptionPropertyEditor, a base class used for
	presenting properties with a limited number of choices.  These
	options are defined in properties, which is why the
	PropertyConsumerPropertyEditor was written as the superclass.
	The ComboBoxPropertyEditor is the first implementation of the
	OptionPropertyEditor, using a JComboBox to display the choices.
	The ColorPropertyEditor was modified to use the DrawingAttributes
	fill paint button to display the color choice in addition to
	showing the hex representation.  The Inspector was modified to
	handle PropertyConsumerPropertyEditors.

2004-05-14  Donald Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Modified the ProjectionFactory to dynamically manage
	projections.  This involved changing the ProjectionFactory from a
	class containing static methods that accessed hard-coded classes
	to a singleton instance that uses the MapHandler to gather
	ProjectionLoaders that it uses to create Projection objects.  A
	BasicProjectionLoader class has been written implementing the
	ProjectionLoader interface, and 5 ProjectionLoader classes have
	been written extending BasicProjectionLoader that create the
	Mercator, CADRG, Orthographic, LLXY and Gnomonic projections.

	The ProjectionFactoryLoader class has been written to be added to
	the openmap.components property in order to put the
	ProjectionFactory instance into the MapHandler.  It can also be
	used to define the properties for ProjectionLoaders, although
	ProjectionLoaders can also be added directly to the MapHandler as
	well.

	Because the change to openmap.properties might catch some people
	by surprise, particularly those who use their own
	openmap.properties file, the BasicMapPanel has been modified to
	check the MapHandler to see if a ProjectionFactory has been added
	to it.  If a ProjectionFactory cannot be found, the singleton
	instance is automatically added with the default set of
	ProjectionLoaders.

	Lastly, the Projection property defined in the openmap.properties
	file has to be a class name, instead of a nickname of one of the
	projection classes.  Some available class names have been added to
	the openmap.properties comments next to that property, and the
	BasicMapPanel has been configured to complain about using the old
	style.
	
	* Added methods to ComponentFactory so that those methods that
	created components from a list of marker names and a set of
	properties could be provided a prefix to place in front of the
	marker name and its properties.

	* Moved/Added I18n handle to OMComponent, OMComponentPanel and
	AbstractOpenMapMenu, to make I18n easier to implement.

	* Modified when/how tooltips are cleared and reset in the
	InformationDelegator.

2004-05-10  Donald Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Modified the StandardPCPolicy so that has the option to be told
	to always spawn a thread when a projection is received.  It used
	to use the number of OMGraphics on it's current list to determine
	if that should happen, but that caused problems if the one
	OMGraphic created took a while to create.  You can pass the new
	flag in a constructor, or set it later.

	* Modified how PlugInLayer handles plugin with the BeanContext,
	so PlugIns added to the layer at a later time still get to work
	with the BeanContext.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.iso8211 package that
	provides support for reading ISO 8211 data files.  Also added the
	com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.asrp package that reads ASRP image
	data.  ASRP images can be displayed using the
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.asrp.ASRPLayer.

	* Added attribute mechanism to OMGeometry/OMGraphic objects.  The
	attributes are stored in a hashtable in the app object of the
	OMGeometry/OMGraphic and can be retrieved with new methods.  The
	code has been written to work with the possibility of other code
	still using the setAppObject and getAppObject methods, as the app
	object set as in older versions of OpenMap is now stored as an
	attribute when other attributes are added.  This should be
	seamless to anybody that is currently using the app object.

	* Created MapBeanPrinterMenuItem and added it to the FileMenu.

	* Modified the BasicMapPanel so the empty constructor doesn't
	create a PropertyHandler that will search for an
	openmap.properties file and fill the application with it.  The
	basic BasicMapHandler will create a MapHandler and
	BufferedLayerMapBean, and an empty PropertyHandler.  To create a
	BasicMapPanel that does look for an openmap.properties file,
	create a PropertyHandler with an empty constructor and pass it to
	the BasicMapPanel.

	* Added I18 contributions to gui package from Mirek Pawlowski.

	* Modified the GestureResponsePolicy interface, adding the
	receivesMapEvents(), mouseOver() and leftClick() methods so the
	policy could receive information about mouse events that were
	occuring over the background map and not over its OMGraphics.  The
	latter two methods only get called when the first returns true.
	Modified the StandardMapMouseInterpreter to use these methods.
	Modified the OMGraphicHandlerLayer to not do anything when these
	methods were called.

	* Added Piotr Kaminski's RhumbCalculator class that computes the
	lengths of Rhumb lines.

2004-04-16  Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>
	* Replaced ext/jakarta-ant-1.5.1/ with ext/apache-ant-1.6.1/

2004-02-13  Don Dietrick  <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added Gordon Vidaver's route calculation package (originally
	derived from Ray Tomlinson's code)
	(com.bbn.openmap.tools.roads), along with two layers that
	provide routes based on the OMGraphics created from their data
	sources (com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape.MultiRoadLayer and
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.vpf.VPFRoadLayer).

2004-02-11  Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>

	* OpenMap 4.6 released.

2004-02-09  Don Dietrick  <dietrick@jade.local>

	* Fixed the problem in OMColorChooser where the preview panel
	wasn't showing up in jdk 1.4.2.

	* Added properties in DrawingAttributes that set the pixel radius
	and oval settings of OMPoints when setTo(OMPoint) is called.

	* Modified the MapHandler to contain a mechanism for handing the
	addition of new components while the membership list is being
	iterated over by another component.  If a component using the
	membership iterator adds something to the MapHandler as a result
	of finding something in it, the new addition will be saved by
	the MapHandler and added later, preventing a
	ConcurrentModificationException from being thrown.

	* Modified the MapBeans to set the clipping area (if null), and
	drawing buffers, to the size of the projection, instead of the
	MapBean.  Usually these are the same, but just in case someone
	wants to try to do something with the projection definitions, it
	should work better.  Since JComponents (Layer superclass) will set
	clipping areas to the size of the component if they are set to be
	larger, you may have to set the FullProjectionRenderPolicy in the
	layers in order to get them to draw fully into the projection
	area if it's bigger than the MapBean.

	* The I18n interface was added, replacing an I18n class that
	wasn't used.  This interface describes a object that provides
	localized strings based on the requesting class, component
	descriptor with optional modifier, and a default string.  The
	BasicI18n class, which implements the I18n interface, was added
	as the base implementation of localization in OpenMap.  The
	Environment class was modified to provide the current I18n
	application instance to components at runtime.  Several
	properties files for different packages were added to the
	distribution, as well as some Polish localized properties files.
	Many thanks to Piotr Kaminski and Mirek Pawlowski for helping us
	work out the Internationalization mechanism and providing
	modified classes and Polish property files.  

	* Modified the com.bbn.openmap.SoloMapComponent interface so it
	has a canAdd() method, to be asked if a component can be added.
	This makes it easier to change the behavior of SoloMapComponent
	objects by overriding one method.

	* Upgraded the PropertyHandler so it writes out properties that
	are more accurate.  The original properties are used, and then
	overwritten by the current components.  If a component doesn't
	provide its current properties, its original properties are
	written.  Before, no properties would have been written for that
	component.

	* Added the mac source directory, which has the capability to
	create a clickable Mac application.  Use the 'mac' target in the
	ant build file.  

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.MapBeanRepaintPolicy interface, which
	handles the layer's requests for repaints as well as modifying
	the java.awt.Graphics object for painting.  The
	StandardMapBeanRepaintPolicy was added to implement the default
	behavior.  The HintsMapBeanRepaintPolicy was added to the package
	to allow RenderingHints to be set on the MapBean.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.proj.EqualArc interface to designate
	those projections that are Equal Arc (constant degree changes in
	both directions).  Modified those layers that required the CADRG
	projection to be use any EqualArc projection, including LLXY.

	* Modified the ToolPanel so it can be told (in its properties)
	which Tools to include in its interface.  It also has the
	capability to be told which tools to ignore and not include.
	This lets you place more than one Tool in the MapHandler, and it
	will show up in the right place.  The ToolPanel will also make
	itself invisible if all of its components are made invisible, and
	reappear if any of them are made visible.

	* The OpenMapFrame has been modified to set its root pane as the
	root pane of the Environment if the Environment has been told to
	use internal windows and the root pane hasn't been set in the
	Environment yet.

	* Modified the OpenMap application to have a method which assigns
	a WindowListener to the application frame.  The default action is
	to exit the application, but this method can be overridden to
	change this behavior.  The OpenMap application also schedules the
	Frame to be shown in the event-dispatching thread, which makes
	the frame appear much more consistently.

	* Modified the WindowSupport object to use JDialogs to keep the
	windows floating on top of the map.  The WindowSupport also now
	has code that tries to make the window appear centered on the
	owner window (thanks to Laura Paterson).

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.gui.ScrollPaneWindowSupport, which is
	an extended WindowSupport that wraps content in a JScrollPane.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.gui.GridBagToolBar, which is a
	JToolBar with a GridBagLayout to have a more compressed look.
	
	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.gui.dock package, which supports the
	new com.bbn.openmap.gui.BasicDockPanel.  This is a new MapPanel
	that allows components to stack up against each other, in
	addition to layering themselves within the panel.  

	* Added the VPFConfig class to the com.bbn.openmap.layer.vpf
	package, a utility that helps configure VPFLayers.  When run in
	standalone mode it displays the coverages and features available
	in the designated VPF library and allows the user to designate
	the DrawingAttributes desired for each feature chosen.  There is
	an option for printing those properties so they can easily be
	added to an openmap.properties file.  The VPFConfig can be
	launched from a running VPFLayer palette to change the features
	the layer is displaying.  It can also be run from within the
	application to create a new layer and provide that layer to the
	LayerHandler, although this functionality hasn't been introduced
	yet.

	* The EsriGraphicList and DbfTableModel classes in the
	com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.shape package have static methods
	included that create an instance of themselves from URLs.  

	* Layers now have a removeable flag that can be set in them, that
	lets GUI widgets know that they shouldn't be removed, and the
	LayerHandler pays attention to that flag to prevent unremoveable
	layers from being deleted from the application.  Fixed bug in
	palette component status events so that palette hide events get
	dispersed properly.

	* Added modifications to the RPF package by Kimberly Hamilton
	(NGC) which added the capability to use frames from other zones
	when zoomed out, to prevent that confusing lack of coverage
	effect at zone boundaries.
	
	* The com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.dted package was greatly enhanced
	with a central DTEDFrameCache that can be shared across layers and
	tools.  The DTEDFrame in that package provides OMGrid objects
	which can use OMGridGenerators to create representations of the
	data.  This updated frame cache can be used by the
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.dted.DTEDFrameCacheLayer, and the different
	GeneratorLoaders used to display the data can be configured and
	modified in the properties file.  The DTEDDirectoryHandler was
	added to load the DTEDFrameCache with a DTED directory, and it
	also handles the configuration of a DTEDNameTranslator, which
	translates how frame files are named in relation to their file
	structure.  This used to be hard-coded, now new classes can be
	written and included in the properties.

	* The com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.dted.DTEDAdmin class can move
	DTED files from one directory to another, filtering the move based
	on file location and dted level.
	
	* The Link package (com.bbn.openmap.layer.link) was modifed to run
	in asynchronous mode, allowing servers to push OMGraphics to the
	client layer on their schedule.  Properties were added for stroke
	patterns, fill patterns, and projection changes so the server can
	control the application's projection.  The LinkArc was added to
	the package as well.

	* A TimerLocationLayer was added to the
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.location package, which includes a timer to
	have the LocationHandlers reload their source data at specified
	intervals.

	* Simon Bowen provided updates to the MIF package
	(com.bbn.openmap.layer.mif), including support for text and point
	objects.

	* Uwe Baier provided the MySQL layer package,
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.mysql.

	* The RenderingHintsRenderPolicy was added, which lets layers
	independently set java.awt.RenderingHints on the
	java.awt.Graphics that its OMGraphics are painted into.  The lets
	the layer set anti-aliasing, etc.

	* The FullProjectionRenderPolicy was added to allow the clipping
	area of the java.awt.Graphics a layer is painting into be the same
	as the current Projection.  The JComponent code limited this to
	the visible size of the Layer, this allows the layer to paint
	into a bigger image buffer.

	* The VPFFeatureCacheGraphicWarehouse was created to provide a
	feature-based tile cache.  This cache is shareable across
	different layers, accessed through the LibraryBean.  Each layer
	gets their own copy of the feature OMGraphics so they can be
	rendered independently from other layers.

	* Added the VPF servlet to the package, at openmap/src/vpfservlet.
	This servlet is for programmers looking to gain an understanding
	of VPF data, as it provides an in-depth view into the structure
	and organization of VPF databases, as well as a direct look into
	the data files.  It's a servlet intended to be run within Tomcat.
	There's a README included in the package that describes what
	files to modify to configure it for your VPF data and Tomcat
	installation.

	* The DrawingAttributes GUI was completely overhauled to have
	dynamic color icon generated to reflect the current colors.  The
	BasicStrokeEditorMenu was created to compress Stroke parameter
	selection, and the EditableOMGraphics now have a standard
	interface to add options to the GUI, so different parameters
	specific to the OMGraphic type can be modified.

	* The com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics.event package was enhanced with
	the addition of the MapMouseInterpreter interface and the
	GestureResponsePolicy.  The MapMouseInterpreter is an object that
	knows how to interpret MouseEvents over OMGraphics, and calls a
	GestureResponsePolicy for information on how to respond.  This
	elevates MouseEvent interpretation to a different level, where
	the programmer only has to receive queries about what to display
	for certain OMGraphics, notifications of OMGraphic selection.
	This capability has been integrated into the
	OMGraphicHandlerLayer.  

	* The FontSizer object was added to the package, which is used by
	the OMText object to resize the font based on scale.  

	* The OMAreaList was added, which takes different types of
	OMGraphics and links them together to make one shape.

	* The OMArc was added, a superclass to the OMCircle.  It can be
	rendered as an open arc, a chorded arc, or a pie arc.

	* The OMEllipse was added, which creates a ellipse in lat/lon
	space with distance axis.  The EditableOMCircle can be used to
	move the OMEllipse, but the axis cannot be modified yet.

	* The EditableOMText object was added, a contribution from Piotr
	Kaminski.

	* OMGrids now use GridData objects to represent their values,
	which is a type wrapper.  GeneratorLoaders were added to the
	package as well.  GeneratorLoaders are factories that create and
	manipulate OMGridGenerators, using properties for configuration
	as well as providing a GUI for runtime manipulation.  Added new
	SlopeGeneration capabilities to the
	com.bbn.openmap.omGraphic.grid package.  Colored and Greyscale
	colors can be used by the SlopeGenerator.

	* The InformationDelegator was modified to handle the dispersion
	of messages to several information lines, with two now
	incorporated into the InformationDelegator.  The CoordMouseModes
	use one (on the left) and layers generally use the one on the
	right.  The right one gets used when the caller doesn't specify a
	location.  Other locations can be added to the
	InformationDelegator list of available lines, and the caller can
	specify when line its information should appear on.
	
	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.event.ListenerSupport class, which
	provides superclass support for other event notification
	classes.

	* Added the MapBeanKeyListener and ProjMapBeanKeyListener classes
	to the com.bbn.openmap.event package, which distribute key event
	that occur when the MapBean has focus.
	
	* MapMouseModes can now have prettyNames, which are the names that
	appear in the GUI as opposed to using the modeID, which was the
	previous case.  The GUI components have been updated to use the
	pretty name in the right cases, and to continue to use the modeID
	for programmatic purposes.

	* The proxy action of the AbstractMouseMode was modified so that a
	mask can be provided to allow certain types of events to pass to
	its targets even if it is acting as a proxy for another
	MouseMode.  This lets the Gestures mouse mode update the
	coordinate display on the InformationDelegator while it acts as a
	proxy for the OMDrawingToolMouseMode, for instance, but letting
	only the mouseMoved MouseEvents pass on in a regular fashion.
	Also, if you hold the shift key down while generating
	MouseEvents, the proxy action is bypassed entirely.

	* Added a method to the DistanceMouseMode that makes it easy to
	subclass it and change the format of the string displayed in the
	InformationDelegator.  Thanks to Piotr Kamiski.

	* The MapBeanPrinter object was added by Bart Jourquin, allowing
	the MapBean to be printed and scaled directly to the Java printer
	interface.
	
	* Modified the propertyEditors that deal with file and directory
	selection to check to see of a File Chooser has included "\\" in
	the path, replacing them with "/" to make the work correctly if
	they are written out to a properties file.

	* Modified the OMDrawingToolLauncher so there are properties that
	define whether to use buttons for different OMGraphic selection or
	a pop-up, and if buttons are chosen the number of buttons to
	display in a single row can be specified.  The order of the
	OMGraphic choices are now the same as they are added to the
	MapHandler (in the openmap.components property or
	programmatically).  

	* The OMDrawingTool was modified to be able to handle movement of
	multiple OMGraphics.  It uses the DrawingToolRequestorList to
	notify the owners of all the OMGraphics when movement is completed.

	* Added the IconFactory package (com.bbn.openmap.tools.icon),
	which creates ImageIcons from vector data and DrawingAttributes
	information.  You provide the factory an IconPart (or IconPartList)
	which contain DrawingAttributes per part, and the size you want
	the icon to be, and the factory creates the image for you.  The
	DrawingAttributes GUI icons are created using the OMIconFactory.

	* Added the beginnings of a MIL-STD-2525 Symbology factory.  It
	doesn't work yet.  Soon.  The
	com.bbn.openmap.tools.symbology.SymbolChooser does show the symbol
	hierarchy, though, and the symbol organization is in place.  The
	last bit, actually building the symbols from cgm files, needs to
	be completed.  The com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.cgm package was
	added to OpenMap for this purpose.  The CGM package was acquired
	from BBN's Cougaar code base.

2003-12-30 Bill Euerle <wjeuerle@bbn.com>

	* Cleaned up numerous javadoc warnings.

	* Updated the VPF layer to more fully use the Java2 Collections
	API.  Removed one (formerly deprecated) method from DcwRecordFile.

2003-06-26 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.gui.time package, which has standard
	GUI controls for controlling time on the map, and
	mapping time rates (real time to some other scenario time).

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.graphicLoader.scenario package, which
	uses location data and activity data to manage movement, against
	time, over the map.  The ScenarioGraphicLoader uses a time slider
	and several time control buttons.

	* Misc changes and bug fixes: Added getters/setters for
	AreaHandler in AreaShapeLayer.  Fixed recursion bug in
	com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics.FilterSupport.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.tools.icon package, containing new
	classes that can be used to create images with pre-packaged scaleable
	geometries.  The application icons will be moving to use
	ImageIcons created from the OMIconFactory and
	IconPartCollections, instead of holding gif and png files in the
	package.  In support of this package, more capabilities were
	added to the com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics.DrawingAttributes class,
	including the ability to render a java.awt.Shape object into a
	java.awt.Graphics object using its parameters.

	* Moved the GraphicLoader classes in
	com.bbn.openmap.plugin.graphicLoader to their own package, in
	com.bbn.openmap.graphicLoader.  The
	com.bbn.openmap.plugin.graphicLoader package remains, for the
	GraphicLoaderPlugIn and GraphicLoaderConnector, two classes that
	use PlugIns and GraphicLoaders.  But the new package contains
	just GraphicLoader stuff, and several implementations and superclasses.

2003-04-25 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Heavy modifications to the CORBA classes.  The build.xml file
	was modified to use the jdk 1.4.1 corba tools and classes instead of
	relying on VisiBroker.  The idl components have been changed to
	work with POA instead of BOA.  Created the
	com.bbn.openmap.util.corba.CORBASupport object to handle the
	client-server startup and resolution functions.  This code used
	to be duplicated across three packages, now they all use this
	class.

	* Added getToolBarGUI to EditableOMGraphic, with first
	implemention in EditableOMPoly.  Will be used for small GUI
	accessories that can be used to modify OMGraphics.

	* Moved DMSLatLonPoint, UTMPoint and MGRSPoint to
	com.bbn.openmap.proj.coords, added UPSPoint, NEDFrame and
	EnuFrame there too as a contribution from Robert Hayes.

2003-04-23 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Modified the OpenMapApplet to look for a PROPERTIES parameter
	in case the properties file to use to configure the applet should
	be different than the standard openmap.properties file.  The
	properties file can be specified as a resource, file or URL, but
	the applet rules apply.

	* Added the ScaleDisplayLayer, contributed by David Ward.  Modified
	it to extend OMGraphicHandlerLayer.

	* Misc bug fixes - the add/delete node states for the
	EditableOMPoly only change to edit cursors when over a node, it's
	now consistent with actual editing behavior.  The equator
	distance for NM in the Planet class was modified to be 2160.
	Modified CSVTokenizer to ignore quotation marks, although a
	quotation mark at the start of a field forces the field to be
	interpreted as a String, and escape characters force inclusion of
	the next charater in a String field.  RpfTocHandler ignores
	commas while checking scale fields.

2003-04-16 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Created the CombinedCoordPanel made from the contents of the
	improved CoordDialog, and modified the CoordDialog and
	CoordInternalFrame to use that instead of creating their own
	content.  Created a CoordsMenuItem that brings up the
	CombinedCoordPanel in a WindowSupport object instead of using the
	CoordDialog and CoordInternalFrame.  Removed support in the
	NavigateMenu for the CenterListener setup of the MapBean and
	specific support for the CoordDialog/CoordInternalFrame, since
	that moved to the CombinedCoordPanel and setup is now supported
	by the menu item.

2003-04-14 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.gui.menu.MenuList component, which
	can create a set of menus from properties, and can provide a
	JMenuBar or JMenu containing those menus.  Maintains order of the
	menus.

	* Changed MapPanel to be an interface to a component that can
	provide its MapBean, MapHandler and menu information(MenuBar
	or single Menu with appropriate sub-menus).  Created the
	BasicMapPanel to implement the MapPanel interface.  Modified
	OpenMapApplet and OpenMapFrame to find a MapPanel, add it to
	their content pane, and ask it for it's JMenuBar.

	* Added a librarian function in the PropertyHandler so you can ask
	it for objects that were created with a particular property
	prefix.  Applies to those components created via the
	openmap.components property.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.gui.dock package, which provides a
	multi-layer layout for OpenMap components.

	* Misc changes: Fixed the area calculation in LabeledOMPoly,
	Location now uses an OMPoint instead of an OMRect.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.gui.MiniBrowser component, which
	displays HTML content for the InformationDelegator.  It has a
	back button, and a button to launch current content in the
	default browser if the content is from a URL.  Uses a JEditorPane
	to display HTML.

	* Changed the WebBrowser temporary file extension from .tmp to
	.html.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.plugin.graphicLoader.scenario package,
	which is a csv-loaded chain-of-events displayed on the map.

	* Created the MapPanel component, which is now the central
	OpenMap application/applet component.  It takes a
	PropertyHandler, or creates one if it isn't given one, and
	creates and MapBean and MapHandler.  It then uses the
	PropertyHandler to get properties to create all of the components
	for the application.  The MapPanelChild interface is for
	top-level components that should be added directly to the
	MapPanel, and it allows the MapPanel to ask where the component
	should be added in its BorderLayout.  The MapPanel can be used on
	any application as a regular Swing widget, basically embedding
	OpenMap into an application or applet.

	* Modified the OpenMapFrame so that it applies to applications
	only, instead of having it be responsible for figuring out when
	it was being used in an applet and have it do the layout for an
	applet.  The OpenMapFrame now looks for the MapPanel and adds it
	to its content pane.  It also looks for a JMenuBar to add to
	itself.  The OpenMap class creates a MapPanel, PropertyHandler
	and OpenMap frame to start the OpenMap application.  The
	OpenMapApplet is now a BeanContextMembershipListener, so it can
	use the MapHandler to find components it needs.  It also creates
	a MapPanel and PropertyHandler, and does its own layout of
	components.
	
	* Added the OMControlPanel, a little all-in-one component
	containing a overview map, all of the projection control widgets,
	and a layers panel.  By default, it likes to be added to the left
	side of the MapPanel.  Also added the ControlPanelToggleMenuItem,
	which locates the OMControlPanel in the MapHandler and can be
	used to hide/show the panel.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.gui.WindowSupport, which provides
	manangement functionality over JFrame/JInternalFrame for
	components that want to emebed themselves or other components in
	a window.  The WindowSupport disposes windows when they are
	dismissed or hidden to save memory and to prevent their existance
	from keeping the jre thread active when parent components are
	removed.  The WindowSupport keeps track of positioning and
	resizing changes and applies them to windows that are re-created
	later for the same component.

	* Misc: Modifed the LayerUtils.getResourceOrFileOrURL method so it can
	better locate resources for applets in the code base.  Fixed the
	problem with the OMRasterObjects for distance triggers, making
	them think they are always filled so they respond to any query
	within their limits.

2003-03-25 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.util.DataBounds and
	com.bbn.openmap.util.DataBoundsProvider interface, and modified
	the GoToMenu to use the
	com.bbn.openmap.gui.menu.DataBoundsViewMenuItem to enable the
	capability to focus the map on a particular data set.  For
	instance, if a ShapeLayer is added to the MapHandler, it will be
	picked up by the DataBoundsViewMenuItem and a menu item for that
	data set will be added to the submenu, allowing the map to be
	recentered and zoomed directly over the area covered by the data.

	* Modified the LayersPanel and LayerPane classes, and added the
	LayerControlButtonPanel.  The LayerControlButtonPanel is a
	configurable OMComponentPanel that contains the buttons to change
	the layer order.  These buttons used to be integrated into the
	LayersPanel, and have been moved into their own panel that is
	configurable via properties (horizontal, vertical, top, bottom,
	right, left, and include/omit add/remove layer buttons).  This
	panel can be added to the LayersPanel in several different ways,
	all configurations available via the properties, but if you don't
	specifiy anything the LayersPanel will appear as before.  The
	LayerPane now notifies the LayersPanel when a layer entry has been
	selected for movement, and that notification gets passed to the
	LayersPanel and on to the LayerControlButtonPanel, and anything
	else that is listening for PropertyChangeEvents.  Notifications of
	layer order changes also pass from the LayerControlButtonPanel to
	the LayersPanel via PropertyChangeEvents.

2003-03-13 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* The directory structure of the OpenMap package has been changed
	in order to make it easier to add external code packages that
	OpenMap classes rely on.  The new structure of the package is:

ANT_ENV.bat 	 - environment configuration for Ant for Windows machines.
AUTHORS 	 - People who have contributed to OpenMap.
CHANGELOG 	 - List of changes between versions.
INSTALL 	 - Installation instructions for compiling.

Makefile	 - Makefile for compiling code, forwards targets to Ant.
README 		 - Start here, information about using OpenMap.
README.win32 	 - additional information for Windows users.
bin 		 - scripts for building, starting the OpenMap application.

		  code.
openmap.properties - default configuration file for the OpenMap application.
share 		  - misc information, applet pages, map data.
src 		  - the OpenMap code packages.

		   openmap.jar file.
src/svg		  - OpenMap code that relies on Apache Batik SVG
		   package.
src/j3d		  - OpenMap code that relies on Java 3D package.
src/corba	  - OpenMap CORBA client-server code that relies on
		   Inprise Visibroker package.


	* OpenMap GUI components have been overhauled.  Previously, most
	of them created the Swing components they needed to provide their
	GUIs.  Now they have been written to extend the Swing classes they
	used to use.  Components that created many Swing objects and
	managed their configuration have been broken into several new
	components that can each use the MapHandler to configure
	themselves.  
	
    	- The OMComponentPanel is a new OpenMap base class that
		extends JPanel.  This class implements the methods of the
		MapHandlerChild (it knows how to work with the MapHandler)
		and has methods that let it act as a PropertyConsumer.

		- The OMToolComponent is a OMComponentPanel extension that
		can provide a GUI face to let it act like an OpenMap Tool.
		The OpenMap Tool behavior can be controlled through
		properties that can be set on the component.
    
		- The InformationDelegator is now an OMComponentPanel, now
		uses the StatusLightPanel instead of creating and managing
		the status icons itself.

		- The OverviewMapHandler is an OMToolComponent, and can
		now beused as a JPanel.

		- The JPanel components in the OMToolSet have been
		separated from the OMToolSet and made into
		OMComponentPanels - the NavigatePanel, the ZoomPanel, the
		ScaleTextPanel.  All can be used individually.  The
		ProjectionStackTool can be used the same way.

	The Menus have been changed, too.  The AbstractOpenMapMenu is the
	base class for all menus, and is capable of being configured via
	properties.  The menu items for all of the menus have been
	converted into JMenuItems that can use the MapHandler to connect
	to other components (LightMapHandlerChild objects).  These
	JMenuItems are stored in the new gui/menu package, and all of the
	old Menus - FileMenu, ControlMenu, NavigateMenu - have been
	updated to use them.  The com.bbn.openmap.gui.menu.OMBasicMenu is a
	menu that can be configured through the properties.

	* The MapHandler has new methods that let you ask for components
	using Class objects.  Also, there are methods that let you receive
	a Collection of objects as a result of queries if more than one
	object meets the query.

	 The methods for the components that use the MapHandler have been
	standardized to the familiar ones defined in the MapHandlerChild
	class.  Most OpenMap components now inherit most of the
	MapHandlerChild methods from a superclass, and override the
	findAndInit(Object) and findAndUndo(Object) methods.  A new
	interface, the com.bbn.openmap.LightMapHandlerChild, specifies
	these two methods as a component that can hook up to other
	components it needs.
	
	* The MapBean now uses a MapBeanRepaintPolicy object to determine
	how it will react to layer repaint requests.  The
	StandardMapBeaRepaintPolicy, used by default, simply forwards all
	requests normally.  The MapBean also forwards projection changes
	in PropertyChangeEvents.

	* The Layer class has changed.  All references to the AWTAvailable
	variable have been removed.  The ImageGenerator, which used this
	variable to try to track Layer threads, has been removed.  The
	Layer.repaint() method now calls MapBean.repaint(layer) if its
	parent is a MapBean.  This is to allow the MapBeanRepaintPolicy to
	take effect.  

	* A MGRSPoint has been implemented, allowing conversions between
	decimal degree lat/lon, UTM and MGRS coordinates.  The UTM and
	MGRS panels have been added to the CoordDialog component.  The
	CoordDialog, in addition to recentering the map on the entered
	coordinates, also converts the coordinates to the other
	representations in the different panels of the dialog.

	 The com.bbn.openmap.plugin.UTMGridPlugIn has been added, which
	draws the UTM zones on the map, labeled below certain scales.  It
	also has the capability of drawing distance grid squares around
	the center point of the projection.  These grids are labeled with
	MGRS grid lables when zoomed in.

	* Thomas Paricaud contributed the e00 layer package, enabling the
	reading of ArcView export formatted files.

	* MouseModes now have a notion of being invisible to the GUI
	(their presence is expected to be noted by another component or
	tool), and also have the ability to act as a proxy for another
	MouseMode.  When a MapMouseMode acts as a proxy for another
	MapMouseMode, it sends all its events to the hidden MapMouseMode.
	This functionality has been built into the AbstractMapMouseMode.
		
	 MouseEvents are now wrapped within a MapMouseEvent by the
	AbstractMapMouseMode.  The MapMouseEvent provides information
	about what MapMouseMode sent the event, provides a handle to the
	MapBean and has a method to provide the latitude/longitude of the
	MouseEvent location.

	 The CoordMouseMode now calls a method for setting up the text
	that gets presented in the GUI for the coordinates of the mouse.
	This lets you easily extend the CoordMouseMode to specify the
	units and format of the string.


	* The OMGraphicHandlerLayer has become the uber-layer for
	OpenMap.  The methods for creating and rendering OMGraphics and
	handing projection changes have been standardized in the
	OMGraphicHandlerLayer, and a SwingWorker added to it.  Almost all
	of the other OpenMap layers are now based on the OMGraphicHandler
	layer, with their SwingWorkers deleted and using the one from the
	super class.  

	 The OMGraphicHandlerLayer now uses two different policy objects,
	one that determines the behavior of the layer when the projection
	changes (should the layer clear out the current OMGraphicList with
	each projection change because it needs to repopulate it based on
	the new projection or reuse all OMGraphics, and should a
	SwingWorker thread be launched) and the behavior for rendering
	OMGraphics.  The prepare() method for an OMGraphicHandlerLayer
	returns the OMGraphicList to be used for a projection, and can be
	called in any thread.  The doPrepare() method launches a
	SwingWorker to call the prepare() method.  Different OpenMap
	layers set different ProjectionChangePolicy and RenderPolicy
	objects depending on the behavior desired and how they gather
	their OMGraphics.

	 The StandardRenderPolicy forwards paint() requests to the render
	method of the OMGraphicList.  The BufferedImageRenderPolicy keeps
	track of how long it takes to paint the OMGraphicList, and if it
	exceeds a threshold it will create a BufferedImage to paint the
	OMGraphicList into.  If paint times decrease, the buffer is
	discarded automatically.

	* Added many OMGraphic package improvements:

		- OMGraphicList has a 'vague' variable added that controls
		certain behaviors.  If an OMGraphicList is vague, it acts
		as a whole OMGraphic, with any child OMGraphics
		contributing to the whole group.  The group gets treated as
		the OMGraphic for find/select requests.  If an
		OMGraphicList is not vague, which is the default, the
		OMGraphicList acts as a pass-through, an organizational
		container for the child OMGraphics.  Methods that also
		modify the internal List have been synchronized on the
		List to avoid ConcurrentModificationExceptions.

		- OMDistance has been added, an OMPolygon with labels at
		each node specifying segment and total distance from the
		first node.

		- OMSpline, OMDecoratedSpline have been contributed by
		Eric Lepicier, along with their decorations and supporting
		Editable classes.

		- Bart Geraci contributed new OMArrowHeads, much improved
		look.

		- OMGraphics now have a getDescription() method, returning
		a String that describes what they are.  When called on an
		OMGraphicList, you get a huge printout of the structure of
		the OMGraphicList and its contents, including the contents
		of any child OMGraphicLists.  

		- OMText now have a setUseMaxWidthForBounds() method,
		which let the background area for Multi-line text appear
		as a bounding box, instead of a form-fitting polygon.


	* Modified the OMDrawingTool by adding a behavior mask, which
	dictates how the OMDrawingTool acts.  There are behavior options
	for deactivating when the mouse is clicked off the edited
	OMGraphic instead of using the pop-up menu or palette Done button,
	presenting the palette, presenting the pop-up menu, presenting the
	pop-up menu on a ctrl-click or right mouse click.  This makes
	using the OMDrawingTool much easier to use for the user.  The
	OMDrawingTool now has a canEdit() method, which lets you ask if it
	can edit a particular Class of OMGraphic without invoking the
	tool.

	* Modified the DrawingToolLayer to have methods that ask whether
	an OMGraphic should be edited (handed to the OMDrawingTool), and
	what the tool tip should be for an OMGraphic.  This makes it
	easier to customize behavior for mouse events in layer subclasses.

	* The BufferedImageHelper will use JAI if it is available to
	create a BufferedImage.  It uses reflection to figure this out, so
	it will compile and run if the JAI is not installed.

	* Added an OMGraphicDeleteTool, a button component that sits in
	the tool panel and listens for events from any other component,
	like the OMDrawingTool, for OMGraphics that have been selected.
	If the button is pressed, the OMGraphicDeleteTool deletes the
	selected OMGraphic by notifying the DrawingToolRequestor to
	delete the OMGraphic.  If the source of the selection is the
	OMDrawingTool, the OMGraphicDeleteTool will tell the
	OMDrawingTool to delete the OMGraphic, which it does by notifying
	the DrawingToolRequestor when the drawing tool deactivates.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.layer.editor package, which contains
	an EditorLayer that extends the DrawingToolLayer.  The EditorLayer
	uses an EditTool to make modifications to its OMGraphics.  Unlike
	the DrawingToolLayer, the EditorTool presents a GUI in the tool
	panel that controls tools specifically for that layer, with uses
	and meanings designated for interaction with that layer.  There
	have been three EditorTools implemented - a superclass
	AbstractDrawingEditorTool that creates an internal OMDrawingTool,
	and two subclasses.  The DrawingEditorTool loads different
	EditToolLoaders into the OMDrawingTool - creating the drawing
	layer that most people were expected before the drawing tool came
	out, with any graphics created going directly to the layer.  The
	DistanceEditorTool has a button to create OMDistance objects,
	which, unlike the DistanceMouseMode, creates distance lines that
	are persistant.  The AbstractDrawingEditorTools use the
	SelectMouseMode to modify OMGraphics that are on the map.  If an
	OMGraphic is being edited, the SelectMouseMode is used as a proxy
	for the internal OMDrawingTool, so the modifications look like
	they are being managed from the Gestures mouse mode.

	* ScaleFilterLayer now presents palettes for layers, forwards
	MapMouseModes to active layer, status event for active layer.
	
	* The EsriGraphicList and DbfTableModel have static methods that
	take a URL to a file and provide an instance of themselves.
	EsriPoint and EsriPolys are cloneable.

	* VPFLayer can be told to get features from a particular library.

	* New icons for the MouseModeButtonPanel.

	* The com.bbn.openmap.plugin.graphicLoader package documentation
	has been improved, and the GraphicLoaderConnector problem caused
	by adding GraphicLoaderPlugIn/PlugInLayers to the MapHandler when
	the GraphicLoader was given a handle to the LayerHandler.  This
	caused a concurrent modification exception.  Now a list of new
	PlugInLayers is maintained, and added to the MapHandler after the
	iteration.

	* The projections have been modified to help out the
	ProjUtils.getScale() method, returning the proper scale for the
	particular projection type.

	* ArgParser can now be told to expect '-' in arguments (for
	negative numbers) instead of automatically assuming that those
	arguments are command arguments.

	* The ComponentFactory can now use reflection to create Objects
	with arguments in their constructors.

2002-12-20 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Moved the CHANGELOG to the top-level directory, in order to help
	people find it.

	* Added a method to the ComponentFactory that lets you ask it to
	create Objects using an Object[] that serves as a set of arguments
	to the constructor.  The method uses reflection to figure out if
	the Object[] contents make sense for the new Object type, and will
	create the new Object if it can.

	* Modified how com.bbn.openmap.proj.ProjUtil.getScale() works, in
	order to get a better scale value.  The calculation has been moved
	back into the Projection objects, and the getScale() method now
	queries the projection for the scale value that is appropriate for
	the situation.

	* Modified how the PlugInLayer works between the MapHandler and
	its PlugIn.  The PlugInLayer used to forward all communication to the
	PlugIn, now it simply adds the PlugIn to the MapHandler and steps
	out of the way.

	* The VPFLayer components have been modified to read data from a
	URL, and the bug that prevented data from being read from a jar
	file by an applet running 1.4.1 has been fixed.  The API for the
	VPF components changed, so that components no longer take a File
	object for the paths, but instead take a String.  Also, code was
	added to prevent multiple File separator characters from appearing
	in file paths.

	* The DrawingTool has been modified to have a notion of behaviors,
	which can be set via an integer mask.  The pop-up menu that used
	to be required to complete modifications to an OMGraphic is no
	longer needed, but remains a behavior option.  By default, it
	still appears with a right-click or ctrl-click.  See java docs for
	details.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.layer.editor package, which contains
	the EditorLayer.  The EditorLayer uses EditorTools to create a
	more application-centric layer, one that needs to capture
	MouseEvents exclusively, and also place a GUI in the ToolPanel
	when the EditorLayer is active.  A DrawingEditorTool is provided,
	which provides the action most likely expected from a drawing
	layer, as opposed to the flexibility that the
	OMDrawingToolLauncher provides.  The DrawingToolEditor makes the
	EditorLayer look like a drawing layer, with the controls and mouse
	events acting on its own OMGraphics.

	* MapMouseModes now have a notion of not being visible, and the
	OpenMap GUI components that display status of MapMouseModes honor that.

	* Misc bug fixes - Layer has correct setAsBackground flag set.  The
	ToolPanel correctly removes Tools that have been removed from the
	MapHandler.  The BinaryFile pays attention to a
	-Ddebug.connection_problems flag, and if it is set it will let the
	Thread sleep for a second.  This is a fix, suggested by Sun, for
	problems that may occur by the client unexpectedly closing down a
	socket too soon before all the data has been read off the stream.
	The LocationLayer GUI has tabs for multiple LayerHandlers again.

	* Modifed the build.xml file so compilations are performed with
	debugging on.

2002-11-08 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>
	* OpenMap 4.5.4 released.
	
2002-11-07 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Modified the openmap lauch scripts so they pick up any changes
	that may have been made to the version in the top level openmap
	directory.  In 4.5.3, the jar had to be rebuilt to contain the
	modified properties file for the changes to take effect.  

	* MapBean changes.  Modified how the background color is handled
	in a MapBean.  If the background is not explicitly set in a
	MapBean, the background color of the projection will be used.  If
	a background is set in a MapBean, that change now only affects
	that particular MapBean.  The OverviewMapHandler can now be set to
	listen to property changes of its source MapBean in case it should
	mimic background settings.  The background can now be set to a
	Paint object as well (use setBckgrnd() methods).

	* There is now a BufferedLayer that can act as a group layer,
	buffering all of its layers into an image.  There are settings
	that can manage how often the buffer is recreated, and these
	settings depend on if the image is transparent and how often the
	group layers repaint themselves between projection changes.

	* There is a BufferedLayerMapBean, which uses a BufferedLayer to
	contain all layers marked as background layers.  This 'background'
	setting has been added to Layer.  When the BufferedLayerMapBean
	receives a new stack of layers, it reads them and adds the
	background layers to its BufferedLayer.  This really helps to
	decrease repaint times.  This layer has not been added as the
	default MapBean in penMap because there isn't a good way to manage
	the layers and notify the user why the layer order may not appear
	the same way as it does elsewhere in the GUI.  A new LayersPanel
	is needed.  However, the BufferedLayerMapBean can be loaded into
	the application by using the -Ddebug.blmb flag.  Using the
	-Ddebug.bllp puts checkboxes in the LayersPanel so you can mark
	layers as background layers.

	* The com.bbn.openmap.tools.beanbox package was updated, and a new
	example package (com.bbn.openmap.examples.beanbox) was added to
	show how to configure and use the beanbox for drag and drop
	additions to the map.

	* EsriPlugIn got many changes and fixes.  The palette will return
	after the first dismissal, the horizontal scroll will appear and
	the table won't be compressed.  If the shp file is the only one
	specified, they the shx and dbf files are assumed to be next to
	it.  The files can be named as files, URLs or resources (relative
	pathnames).  EsriPlugIns can be created dynamically.

	* The Shape dataAccess package was modified.  Exports are more
	reliable and you can specify if the DBF file should be written.
	Sublists are only created for multipart geometries.  OMGraphics
	created from Shape file records will be held directly in the top
	level OMGraphicsList instead of being held in a sublist.  Null
	fields in the dbf file don't cause number exceptions.

	* The GraphicLoader concept was much refined, with the creation of
	an AbstractGraphicLoader that has a pre-defined timer, etc.  A
	GraphicLoader is a component that creates OMGraphics on it's own
	schedule, and then notifies a receiver to paint the
	OMGraphicList.  The GraphicLoaderConnector is a component that
	lives in the MapHandler and looks for GraphicLoaders in the
	MapHandler that do not have a component that is receiving its
	OMGraphics.  If it finds on, it creates a
	PlugInLayer/GraphicLoaderPlugIn automatically to display objects
	on the map.
	
	* OMGraphic modifications:

	OMGraphics now have a notion of a TextureMask variable that can be
	used to hold a TexturePaint object.  If the TexturePaint object as
	some transparency in its image, the OMGraphic's fillPaint will
	show through the fill pattern.

	The OMRasterObjects now correctly update their Java Shapes
	correctly.  This fixes the problem where icons were not responding
	to gestures.  

	OMScalingRaster now has access to the clipping rectangle, a Java
	2D rectangle that specified what part of the image is on the map.
	
	OMArrowHeads for OMLines have their wingtip and winglength
	attributes exposed so they can be adjusted.  Their rendering was
	improved with relation to matting, filling.
	
	OMGraphics were modified so that fill color matters with regard to
	distance.  Clear shapes will be treated as lines, without
	area.  OMLines are never treated as being with area (affects great
	circle lines) no matter what the fillPaint settings are.

	* MouseModes can now provide an Icon.  The MouseModeButtonPanel
	can be used with those icons.  If a MouseMode doesn't provide an
	icon, an name will be used instead.

	* Modified the SVGFormatter so it gets all the individual layer
	graphics properly from a BufferedMapBean.

	* Eliot Lebsack from Mitre provided a couple of new classes -
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape.ShapeFileCrop, can create a new Shape
	file with shapes from a certain area of another Shape file, and
	com.bbn.openmap.gui.SaveAsVirtualImageMenuItem, which lets you
	set the size of an image to create from the current map.

	* The SaveAsMenuItems now add an image-appropriate suffix to file
	names when an image is saved.  They also check and confirm that a
	duplicate image will be overwritten.

	* The MapRequestHandler can now be set to use Layer visibility
	settings to determine what layers should be used for an image.
	
	* Misc layer improvements: Many Layers had properties renamed to
	not have a '.' in the front of them, and their setProperties
	methods have been modified to work with or without a property
	prefix.  GraticuleLayer has font size property.  DTED file
	components do better checking for null fields.  ETOPOLayer updated
	to read ETOPO2 data.  LocationLayer has LayerHandlers access
	exposed.  The RpfProductInfo now has catalog static methods to
	print out information on all of the various data types.

	* Fixed bug where gestures were not accessing information on
	AreaShapeLayer graphics where the attributes were loaded via a dbf
	file.

	* Fixed the OMDrawingToolLauncher so it receives its list of
	EditToolLoaders from the OMDrawingTool, instead of finding them on
	its own.

2002-07-24 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>
	* OpenMap 4.5.3 released.
	
2002-07-24 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>

2002-07-21 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added Oliver Hinds' OMColorChooser preview panel, so you can see
	what the color looks with the transparency setting before you hit
	OK.

2002-07-20 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Incorporated Raj Singh's updates to the WMSPlugIn, which bring
	it into compliance with WMS specification version 1.1.0, including
	some error handling and JPEG image quality requests.

	* Incorporated Lonnie Goad's updates to the EsriPlugIn, which
	improved GUI interaction, table interaction, and provided tool
	tips over OMGraphics on the map that reflect the DBF contents for
	that graphic.

	* Fixed problems in the com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.shape package.
	The ShpOutputStream was putting in the wrong record number
	(started at 0 instead of 1), and fixed a couple of problems with
	export, including a problem with handling embedded lists, and
	translating DrawingAttributes from OMGraphics that were converted
	to EsriPolygons and EsriPolylines.

2002-07-18 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added ProgressEvent, ProgressListener and ProgressSupport
	classes to the com.bbn.openmap.event package.  These objects
	provide a way for a component to let someone else know how much of
	a task is done.  This has been integrated into the MakeToc class
	in the RPF package.

	* Added a 'matted' property in the OMGraphic object.  If
	setMatted(true), then the OMGraphic gets drawn with a thin, 1
	pixel black line around it.  Makes it more distinctive, especially
	in busy backgrounds.

	* Changed the graphicLoader package, making it much more
	significant.  The GraphicLoader is an interface, representing an
	object that creates OMGraphics from some source and sending it to
	a receiver that will rendering it on a map.  The
	AbstractGraphicLoader is an OMComponent that contains all the
	basic GraphicLoader functionality, along with the basic ability to
	use the MapHandler to find objects and being a PropertyConsumer,
	so it's ready to be initialized with properties in the
	openmap.properties file.  The MMLGraphicLoader is additionally
	prepared to receive MouseEvents.  The LOSGraphicLoader is the old
	GraphicLoader that lets things wander on the map, while keeping
	track of what objects are in LOS of each other.

2002-07-17 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Made modifications to OMGraphics.  Made the OMLine handle arrow
	heads properly.  Made arrow heads bigger.  Made OMGrid more
	consistant and fixed bugs in column and row handling.  Added an
	empty sort() method on OMGraphicList which can be extended with
	customized sorting criteria.  Added a sort action constant mask to
	OMGraphicConstants.  Added setSelected() and isSelected() methods
	to OMGraphic.

	* Added better trapping for SVGFormatter errors in the FileMenu.

	* Added the OMComponent, which is a MapHandlerChild and a
	PropertyConsumer, reflective of an object being added to the
	openmap.components property of the openmap.properties file.
	LayerHandler was changed to extend it.

	* Modified Environment.java to handle internal frames
	independently of being in applet mode.

	* Modified the build.xml file.  The OpenMap package builds things
	differently, too.  First, all compiled classes are placed in the
	classes/openmap directory, except for the CORBA classes which are
	placed in the classes/corba_vb directory.  Second, all of the
	openmap classes are placed in the openmap.jar file.  omcontrib.jar
	and omcore.jar are no longer created.  All of the CORBA classes
	are placed in the omcorba_vb.jar if the corba build target
	(visibroker) is created.

	* Added Jakarta Ant 1.4.1 to the OpenMap package, making OpenMap
	pretty much self-compiling.  All of the infrastructure for the
	original Makefiles have been removed, and replaced with Makefiles
	that call ant.

2002-06-21 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Modifed the build.xml file to handle the corba classes better.

	* Created the MakeTocException, and the
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.rpf.MakeToc class now throws that exception
	instead of calling System.exit(), in case it is embedded into a GUI.

2002-06-18 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Misc bug fixes in several classes, fixing null pointer
	exceptions, security access exceptions, etc.

2002-06-13 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Modified the EsriShapeExport class so that a GUI is not brought
	up to save the files if a file path is provided.

	* Fixed a bug in OMPoly that prevented internal Shape objects from
	being created if soShapes == false.

2002-06-03 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>
	* OpenMap 4.5 released.
	
2002-05-29 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Modified MIFLayer to be an OMGraphicHandlerLayer.

	* Modified the clone() method in Proj.java, so that the internal
	Mercator projection used for complex lines gets deep cloned on
	copies.  This allowed removal of a synchronized block of code.

	* Added edit methods on the DrawingTool that take a MouseEvent.
	These additional edit methods put the EditableOMGraphic directly
	into edit mode instead of selected mode, so that mouse events have
	an immediate effect on the OMGraphic.  Makes for quicker editing
	in some cases.  Also, a setAllowGUIOption method was added to
	OMDrawingTool so that the palette for an EditableOMGraphic can be
	brought up from the pop-up menu, if the user wants it.

	* BufferedMapBean and MapBean have had their clipping restrictions
	lifted, in order to provide a way to have smoother animation.  Partial
	maps may be drawn if another layer trys to render itself,xc not
	knowing if there is a clipping rectangle set on the MapBean, so
	just be aware of that if you set the clip rectangle on them.

2002-05-28 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Fixed that annoying NullPointerException in the
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape.ShapeLayer.renderDataForProjection()
	method.

	* Overhauled the com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics package.  The changes
	are extensive, but the use of OMGraphics is backward compatible.

	The biggest change is that internally, OMGraphics represent
	themselves as java.awt.Shape objects (actually, GeneralPaths)
	after they are projected/generated.  After generation, the Shape
	object can be retrieved by OMGraphic.getShape().  The Java Shape
	interface provides different spatial operations you can perform on
	other shapes - contains, intersects, getBounds.
	
	The first new thing to notice is the
	com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics.OMGeometry interface, which is a basic
	interface describing renderable shapes.  The most basic
	implementation of this interface is the abstract class
	com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics.geom.BasicGeometry, which contains the
	code that manages Shape creation.  OMGraphic now extends
	BasicGeometry, adding DrawingAttributes information to describe
	how the Shape should be rendered (linePaint, fillPaint, Stroke).

	There is now an OMGeometryList, which extends OMGraphicList.  The
	difference between them is that OMGeometryList contains OMGeometry
	objects, and when an OMGeometryList is generated, all of the
	OMGeometry objects contribute to a single Shape object (disjointed
	or not), with the DrawingAttributes of the OMGeometryList
	dictating how the Shape is drawn.  The
	com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics.geom package contains these OMGeometry
	objects, of which there are two currently implemented -
	PolygonGeometry and PolylineGeometry.  When rendering an list of
	graphics that share the same color and stroke types, using an
	OMGeometryList with a single Shape obejct is faster than using an
	OMGraphicList with separate OMGraphics.

	Some other omGraphic package improvements:
	- Moved the OMArrowHead calculations from OMLine to OMArrowHead.
	- Removed dependency on java.awt.Toolkit from OMBitmap and
	OMRaster in favor of BufferedImage.

	To add control over managing OMGraphics, the OMGraphicHandler
	interface was created.  This interface defines methods to interact
	with a component that has OMGraphics, including spatial
	filtering.  The FilterSupport object helps objects implement this
	interface.  The abstract classes OMGraphicHandlerLayer and
	OMGraphicHandlerPlugIn are OMGraphicHandlers that use FilterSupport.

	Layers that implement the OMGraphicHandler interface -
	GraticuleLayer, DemoLayer, DrawingToolLayer, ShapeLayer.  
	
	Other layer improvements that take advantage of the OMGeometry
	changes:
	- ShapeLayer2.java - A shape layer that uses the new OMGeometry
	objects.  BufferedShapeLayer uses the new OMGeometryList.  The
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape.EsriRecord components handle
	OMGeometryLists and OMGeometry graphics.
	- The com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape.areas.AreaHandler groups all
	like areas together in a OMGeometryList.
	
	As a side note, OMRaster and OMBitmap create rectangles outlining
	their shape.  OMGrid hasn't been modified to do anything in
	particular with it's Shape object pointer.

	* Created a com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess package, which is intended
	to hold components that access particular data types.  As an
	example, the com.bbn.openmap.plugin.esri components that were
	responsible for directly reading and writing shape files, were
	moved to com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.shape.  The rpf, dted, mif,
	etopo, and other data components will follow.  Note that the
	EsriPlugIn and EsriLayer classes in the
	com.bbn.openmap.plugin.esri package still exist.

	* Incorporated a submission by Karl Stuempfle and Lonnie Goad
	working for OptiMetrics, Inc.  that provides a way to take an
	OMGraphicList and export it to a (or up to three) Shape files.
	The class that does this is
	com.bbn.openmap.dataAccess.shape.EsriShapeExport.  If a dbf file
	isn't specified in the OMGraphicList.AppObject(), one will be
	created for each .shp file, and it will contain the rendering
	attributes for the OMGraphics.  The
	com.bbn.openmap.plugin.esri.EsriPlugIn reads the dbf file and
	looks for these attributes in it.  If they are there, they are
	used, otherwise the default settings are used to render the shape
	graphics.  

	The DbfTableModel was modified, and augmented with the
	MetaDbfTableModel, to allow direct editing and modification of the
	Dbf files.

	The DrawingToolLayer was modified to use the EsriShapeExport class
	to export its graphics when a button is clicked on its palette.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.tools.j3d package, which contains
	components for creating a Java 3D scene, and creating and
	controlling a viewer for that scene.  This package requires that
	the Java 3D extension package
	(http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/index.html) in order
	to compile and run.

	There are some basic components to this package:
	- The OM3DManager is the abstract object that creates a 3D scene
	and loads it with objects.  The MapContentManager is a basic
	manager that creates a view window that is controlled by the arrow
	keys.  The ControlledManager creates a view window that is
	controlled by an outside component, and the
	com.bbn.openmap.plugin.pilot.PilotPath is an example of an object
	that controls it.
	- The OMKeyBehavior class is a behavior class that controls
	movement of the camera over the scene.
	- The MapContent class controls how components are added to the
	scene.  Map objects are added to the scene in different ways,
	check the javadocs for more information.

	There is still work to do in this package.  Give feedback, money
	or code and guide where it goes.
	
	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.plugin.pilot package, which is
	a demo package to show how to use the j3D package.  The user can
	add paths for a 'pilot' to follow, and then create a view into a
	3D scene that changes as the 'pilot' moves over the map.
	
	* New OpenMap .NET XML Web Services code has been written and included
	in the openmap/iis directory.  A demo of this code, which is a
	html OpenMap client, will be set up at http://www.openmap.net (get
	it?) eventually, but a link from the main OpenMap web page will
	direct you to it as well.
	
	There are two directories in the OpenMap.net project:
	ImageWebService and OpenMapWeb.
	
	ImageWebService contains the .NET XML Web Services.  There are
	three of them: ProperService.asmx, GetMapService.asmx, and
	TimerService.asmx.  
	- ProperService is responsible for starting and killing Java Image
	servers, updating user sessions, keeping information about layers
	used.
	- GetMapService service has three methods: GetMapImage,
	RecenterMap, PanMap.  It uses ProperService to start Java processes
	as needed.
	- TimerService is a utility that will call CleanServerProcs()
	method in ProperService every certain number of minutes to check
	whether it's time to kill some java servers.
	
	The <appSettings> section in web.config file in ImageWebService
	folder is used to configure web services to point to the Java
	OpenMap installation and openmap.properties file.

	The OpenMapWeb folder contains two ASP.NET files: WebMap.aspx and
	MapImage.aspx.
	- WebMap.aspx is the user interface to the project.
	- MapImage.aspx is used to contact a web service to get raw image
	data.

	To support this service, additional functionality was added to the
	ImageServer class:

	- the PAN, AZIMUTH, X and Y arguments were added to the parsable
	argument list, allowing the client to send the server panning and
	centering commands (based on the current image projection).
	- if the 'layers' property is not defined for the ImageServer
	(including the MapRequestHandler) to use to configure the default
	layers, then the 'openmap.layers' property will be used to create
	the layers available to the ImageServer, and the
	'openmap.startUpLayers' property will define the default layer list.
	
	* Modified the build files and the build.xml ant file so that
	source files that require other software packages will not be
	included in the general build, but can be built with modifications
	to some settings.  There are three main groups of addition code
	that are controlled this way:

	- the Java 3D components in the com.bbn.openmap.tools.j3d package,
	which depend on the Java 3D package from Sun.
	- the SVGFormatter in the com.bbn.openmap.image package, which depends
	on Batik, see entry below regarding SVG creation.
	- the CORBA components in com.bbn.openmap.layer.rpf.corba (existed),
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.specialist (new) and
	com.bbn.openmap.plugin.corbaImage (new) packages, which are all
	configured to compile and run with the Visibroker CORBA
	implementation.  The are based on the BOA model, so if anyone
	wants to translate that to POA and updated them to work with the
	CORBA classes in the Java distributions, please do.

	* SVG creation is now supported.  Added the SVGFormatter class to
	the image package, created from code contributed by Sebastien
	Prud'homme.  This class requires the installation of the Batik
	package (http://xml.apache.org) to compile and use.  If the Batik
	classes are found at runtime, the SVG option is added to the File
	-> Save As menu.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.layer.specialist package.  This
	package has actually been around since OpenMap started.  It's a
	client-server package that transfers OMGraphic-like objects.
	Doesn't transfer OMGrids or OMPoints graphics.  There are
	implemenations of servers for DTED, Shape and VPF data.  All use
	the CSpecLayer for the client.  The Specialist.idl file needs to
	be compiled (idl2java) to create the com.bbn.openmap.CSpecialist
	package, which gets compiled and put into the cspec58.jar file.
	All of the other classes get put into the specialist.jar file.  To
	used this package, these jars, along with the Visibroker jar
	files, need to be added to the classpath using the -Xbootclasspath
	java flag.  The rt.jar java runtime jar needs to be added to the
	bootclasspath as well, but after the Visibroker jars.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.plugin.corbaImage package, which is a
	corba-based version of the SHISPlugIn/SimpleHttpImageServer
	client-server setup.  The package has a corba-based server that
	creates image objects sent to the client plugin.

	* The Corba RPF package has been improved.  The server now has
	settings for the maximum number of caches to use, and a timer that
	cleans them up after a certain amount of time.

	* Modified the examples (com.bbn.openmap.examples packages) to
	show how to use the MapHandler for even simple applications.
	Moved the examples away from connecting components manually.

	* Added the OMScalingRaster, created from a contribution from
	Adrian Lumsden (and as I understand, with help from Steve
	McDonald).  It's an extension to the OMRaster object that takes an
	upper left and lower right coordinate, and automatically scales
	its source image according to the projection in generate().  It
	does *not* warp the image to match the projection, it just does
	straight scaling.

	Because of this class, the
	com.bbn.openmap.plugin.CSVTiledImagePlugin was created to use
	them.  It uses a CSV file to list coverage coordinates and URLs of
	images.  This PlugIn does not do any real management of the images
	other than to load them and use them - it doesn't drop images that
	aren't used on the map, etc.  Those are saved as improvements for
	later.

	Also, the RpfLayer code (RpfSubframe) now uses the OMScalingRaster
	for the Rpf subframe tiles.

	* Added some new functionality to the com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape
	package.  Created the MultiShapeLayer, which can display one or
	more shape files.  The palette for this layer provides controls
	for adding buffering and rendering behaviors.  The AreaHandler in
	the com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape.areas now also uses dbf files, in
	addition to csv files.

	* AppletDataNugget has been deprecated, it's not needed anymore.
	BinaryFile has been fixed to be able to find files in jar files
	from an applet as expected.

	* Modified the Layer parent class, adding a Projection variable
	for all subclasses to use.  Accessor methods that take projection
	events and projections to get to the projection variable were also
	added.  Added Layer.projectionChanged() method that sets this
	projection variable.  Most layer subclasses will probably have
	their own version of the projectionChanged() method, so it can be
	called if desired.  The OpenMap layers that used to save a copy of
	the projection have been updated to use the new method and the
	Layer.projection variable.

	* Added the Quantize.java class, written by Adam Doppelt, to the
	contrib/doppelt directory.  The Acme GIF creation code has been
	modified to use Quanitize if the image being encoded has more than
	255 colors.  Because of this improvement, the GIF option has been
	added to the File -> Save As menu.
		
	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.plugin.graphicLoader package, which is
	a demo package to show how to use the LOS code in the
	com.bbn.openmap.tools.terrain package.  The user can add points
	over the map, some stationary, some wandering, some following a
	path, and the components figure out if they can see each other,
	drawing a dynamic network on the map.

	* Fixed a bug in the SoloMapComponentReplacePolicy where the
	replaced SoloMapComponent wasn't actually removed before being
	replaced.

	* Fixed a bug in LayerHandler where hasLayer() only checked the
	first layer, instead if iterating through all of them.

	* Updated the Link package so that OMBitmap, OMCircle, OMGrid,
	OMLine, OMPoint, OMRect, OMRaster, OMText and OMPoly objects are
	able to be written to the link via the LinkGraphic.write() method.

	* OMDrawingTool now makes distinction between new graphics and
	updated graphics when it notifies the DrawingToolRequestor.   The
	OMGraphicList properly handles the OMAction that reflects these
	changes, adding updated graphics it doesn't currently have, adding
	new graphics, and doing nothing for updated graphics it has.

	* ProjectionStack now picks up changes to Background color changes
	to the MapBean.

	* Added a MouseModeButtonPanel to the gui package.  This can be
	used instead of the MouseModePanel (option menu).  Right now, the
	buttons display the MouseModeID text.  If the <id>.gif file is
	found as a resource, that image would be used on the button
	instead.  We haven't designed images yet.

	* Misc changes:
	- EarthquakeLayer default sites updated.
	- Fixed layout of CoordPanel and DMSCoordPanel.
	- Environment class adjusted so that for the Windows platform, the
	XWindowsWorkaround for improved clipping performance is	enabled.  
	- The Environment was also changed to handle internal windows
	better.  It now containes a JLayeredPane to use as a desktop.  All
	OpenMap components that consider using internal windows have been
	updated to use the new setup.
	- The DMSLatLonPoint has been updated to use floats for its
	internal seconds representation, for better precision.
	- app/RouteLayer was removed, it was redundant.
	- Projections now use/return ArrayLists instead of Vectors.

2001-12-11 William Euerle <wjeuerle@bbn.com>

	* Numerous changes to VPF layer code to make it more robust.  A
	few minor performance improvements.  Some initial code to handle
	"node" features - this code is not yet complete.

2001-11-21 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Created the openmap/share/openmap.jnlp file, which demonstrates
	how to set up a file to be used with Java WebStart.  MacOS X users
	and anyone else with Java WebStart installed can click on that
	file and the openmap applet will launch and run on the desktop.
	You can also use the WebStart file on our demo location at
	http://dstl.bbn.com/openmap/openmap.jnlp

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics.labeled package, which will
	be the future home of OMGraphics that have text labels attached to
	them.  Only the LabeledOMPoly was implemented.  The LabeledOMPoly
	lets you attach a text object to a specific node, or you can tell
	it to center the text within the poly.  The polygon parameters can
	be modified with the OMDrawingTool, but the text attributes
	cannot.  The text can only be modified programmatically.

	* Added typing controls in the com.bbn.openmap.plugin.esri package
	to scoped things a little better.  Includes fixes for the
	NullPointerExceptions found in the last version.  The Tester.java
	class was added as an example of how to use the shapefile creation
	capabilities of the package.

	* Fixed a NullPointer bug in the OMToolSet.

	* Added the MapWindow, a simple JFrame widget that contains a
	MapBean, MapHandler, MouseDelegator and LayerHandler.  Easy to add
	a map to your application.

	* Cleaned up how layers are deleted.  Fixed MapBean bug where all
	layers were receiving remove() calls in certain situations.
	Cleaned up how the InformationDelegator was releasing listeners to
	the palette triggers.  The LayerSupport and other listeners were
	adding duplicates to their lists in some situations, which
	hampered clean up, too.  
	
	* Fixed bug in DMSLatLonPoint where the lat/lons weren't being set
	properly.

	* Modified the ANT_ENV.bat file with better support for
	configuring the Windows environment for Ant.  Also updated the
	README.win32 with instructions to set up Ant to build OpenMap.

	* OpenMap 4.4.1 was released a day after 4.4, with some
	modifications to the com.bbn.openmap.plugin.esri package.

2001-11-01 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>
	* OpenMap 4.4 released.
	
2001-11-01 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* PropertyConsumer handling has been very significantly improved,
	thanks to a code submission from Bernhard Reiter and Kai Lessmann.

	First, there is a new package, called
	com.bbn.openmap.util.propertyEditor.  It contains generic
	PropertyEditor classes, and an Inspector class that uses the
	PropertyConsumer's methods to provide an interface to set and
	modify properties.

	You can run the Inspector as an application on any
	PropertyConsumer class to test out what that interface looks like,
	and to see if there are any problems loading the Inspector with
	the contents of the PropertyConsumer's properties.

	The Inspector exects that the properties returned in the
	PropertyConsumer.getProperties() method will be scoped, i.e.  that
	if a property prefix is used, the properties will also have that
	prefix in front of the properties.

	The Inspector uses the PropertyConsumer.getPropertyInfo() method
	of classes to get information about the properties being
	displayed.  The Inspector does not expect that the properties
	returned in this method will be scoped - Just the base properties
	should be returned as keys, with their values being a short
	explaination for what the property represents.  This explaination
	is used as a tool tip in the interface.  Also in this method,
	properties can be set with the key having a '.editor' suffix, with
	the value of the property being the fully qualified class name of
	the PropertyEditor to use to adjust that property.

	So, while a class might return a (prefix.lineColor, AARRGGBB)
	property from the getProperties method, it would return a
	(lineColor, "Color used for lines") property and a
	(lineColor.editor,
	"com.bbn.openmap.util.propertyEditor.ColorPropertyEditor")
	property in the getPropertyInfo() method to use to adjust the
	fillColor property.

	The PropertyConsumer now has a EditorProperty string 'editor' and
	a ScopedEditorProperty string '.editor' which makes it easier to
	define PropertyEditor properties on the fly.

	The submission also includes a com.bbn.openmap.gui.LayerAddPanel,
	which can be brought up by the LayersMenu, or the LayersPanel.  It
	uses a property called openmap.addable to set a list of Layer and
	PlugIn classes that can be created at runtime, and configured
	using the Inspector.  Each unique marker name (separate from the
	marker names used in the openmap.layers list) needs to have a
	.class property defined for it (what to instantiate), and a
	.prettyName property (a generic GUI name for the layer).  The
	LayerAddPanel provides a place to actually name specific layer
	instatiations, and the prefix for those layers are automatically
	generated (see PropertyHandler changes).

	One more note on this - You'll notice that we've changed the
	property definitions so that they *DON'T* include a scoping period
	at the front of them.  The PropertyConsumer interface has a
	setProperties(Properties) method, so the PropertyConsumer can be
	configured without a property prefix.

	This really applies to developers that configure their layers
	programmically.  If you define a Properties object that is only
	used by one Layer (or other PropertyConsumer type) you don't have
	to scope the properties.  i.e.

	ShapeLayer shapelayer = new ShapeLayer();
	Properties shapeprops = new Properties();

	shapeprops.put("shapeFile", shapefilepath);
	shapeprops.put("lineColor", shapefilepath);

	// or
	// shapeprops.put(ShapeLayer.shapeFileProperty, shapefilepath);
	// shapeprops.put(ShapeLayer.lineColorProperty, shapefilepath);

	shapelayer.setProperties(shapeprops);

	You could do this:

	ShapeLayer shapelayer = new ShapeLayer();
	Properties shapeprops = new Properties();
	String shapeprefix = "uniqueshape";
	shapeprops.put(shapeprefix + ".shapeFile", shapefilepath);
	shapeprops.put(shapeprefix + ".lineColor", shapefilepath);

	// or
	// shapeprops.put(shapeprefix + "." + ShapeLayer.shapeFileProperty, shapefilepath);
	// shapeprops.put(shapeprefix + "." + ShapeLayer.lineColorProperty, shapefilepath);

	shapelayer.setProperties(shapeprefix, shapeprops);

	But you don't have to if the shape layer is the only layer using
	the Properties object.

	But, if you use the Properties object for all of your properties
	definitions, then you have to use the prefix to ensure that the
	layer picks up the properties meant for it.

	* The PropUtils had methods added that are really helpful to use
	for the PropertyConsumer methods.
		
	String prefix = PropUtils.getScopedPropertyPrefix(PropertyConsumer ps);
	String prefix = PropUtils.getScopedPropertyPrefix(String prefix);

	Either return an empty string ("") for null prefixes, or the
	prefix with a period attached.  Either way, the properties in
	getProperties can be defined by calling the method above, and
	simply putting it in front of the property name.

	* The PropertyHandler has been updated to keep track of
	usedPrefixes, and can test and modify suggestions for new prefixes
	if asked.  The LayerAddPanel uses this when new layers are created
	at runtime.

	The PropertyHandler has also been modified to take a PrintStream
	and the MapHandler, and create a openmap.properties file.  It can
	also read in a openmap.properties file at runtime (which is
	essentially loading a new map).  The application components are
	not affected by the contents of a newer openmap.components
	property in the new file.  Just the layer properties are used, and
	the projection settings.

	When a new openmap.properties file is created, the
	openmap.components property that was set in the lauched properties
	file is reused.  New components that may have been added at
	runtime have not been added.  This is a temporary workaround to
	the problem that occurs when pulling objects out of the MapHandler
	- they do not come out in any specific order, which really affects
	the look of any application that may try to load components with
	that order.  That's also why the application ignores the
	openmap.components property of any openmap.properties file loaded
	later.

	The FileMenu was modified to have 'Load Map...' and 'Save Map...'
	options, using the SavePropertiesMenuItem.

	* Modified for PropertyConsumer compliance.  These are layers ready to
	be created at runtime:

	- DrawingAttributes.java (just so you know for your layers)
	- EarthquakeLayer.java GraticuleLayer.java (also uses Inspector for
	 runtime modifications via palette)
	- com.bbn.openmap.layer.location
	- com.bbn.openmap.layer.rpf
	- com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape
	  The areas package has not been updated for PropertyConsumer
	  methods yet.  However, the AreaHandler was reworked to provide
	  better access and control over the area definitions.

	* The PlugInLayer and PlugIn were updated to use the
	PropertyConsumer interface, and they resolve between themselves
	how to handle properties in the different situations where the
	PlugInLayer was created and defined the PlugIn, or when the PlugIn
	was created and the LayerAddPanel or LayerHandler created the
	PlugInLayer for it.

	This makes a difference on how properties are represented in
	openmap.properties files saved by the application.

	The WebImagePlugIn abstract class was created, which defines code
	shared by the shis and wms plugin pacakges.  This code really
	affects the PropertyHandling, and the palettes, which take
	advantage of the Inspector to allow modification of their
	parameters at runtime.  There is also a palette option to see what
	the query to the web server looks like before it is actually sent.

	* The Layer class has been updated so that it contains the handle
	to its palette, instead of having the LayerPane manage
	it.  Layer.showPalette() and Layer.hidePalette() methods have been
	added, and the gui components have been modified as well.
	ComponentListeners to the Layer will receive events about the
	palette, too, telling them when the palette has been activated or
	hidden.

	The Layer is now an ActionListener in order to receive commands to
	show and hide its palette.  It also can receive commands
	(Layer.DisplayPropertiesCmd) to bring up the Inspector, which uses
	the PropertyConsumer interface to set the layer's properties.

	The Layer.RedrawCmd has been defined, too, but individual layers
	have to code how to specifically react to it.

	The Layer has a new property, autoPalette, which can be used to
	tell if the palette for a layer should be turned on by default.
	The MapBean has a new method, MapBean.showLayerPalettes(), that
	calls Layer.showPalette() on all layers with this property set to
	true.  MapBean.hideLayerPalettes() turns them all off.

	The OpenMap application now calls this new MapBean method at
	startup.  The result - you can have certain layer palettes come up
	automatically at application startup by setting a layer property.

	The Layer had a findAndInit(Object) method added, which is called
	by findAndInit(Iterator) when objects are added to the MapHandler.
	See comments on changes to MapHandlerChild on why this is good.

	Property handling in general for layers is improving.  With the
	addition of the Inspector, you should make sure that all the
	PropertyConsumer methods in your layers are implemented, and that
	calling setProperties() in your layer reconfigures it if needed.  Not
	all of the OpenMap layers have been modified yet to act properly in
	this way, but many have.

	* The LayerHandler was updated to be able to create PlugIn
	directly from the openmap.layers property list.  If the
	LayerHandler finds a PlugIn, it will automatically create a
	PlugInLayer for it and hook it up to the PlugIn.  Likewise, the
	properties for the PlugIn can be scoped in the properties file
	exactly like a layer: 

	plugin_markername.class=com.bbn.openmap.plugin.PlugIn
	plugin_markername.prettyName=Example
	plugin_markername.<whatever>=

	The former way to add PlugIns, within a PlugInLayer defined in the
	openmap.layers list, still works as before.

	* The MapBean has been altered to provide an option to release
	Layers that have been removed from it right away.  Previously, the
	MapBean actually held on to layers that were removed, in case they
	were added again without the projection changing.  This prevented
	the layer from doing unnecessary work just by being toggled on and
	off the map, but we got requests to make this an option.

	* Added a method to the MapHandler (BeanContext) called get(String
	classname), that looks at its contents and returns an object of
	that type.  Handy for getting the MapBean, LayerHandler, etc.  or
	any SoloMapComponent from the MapHandler when it's actually
	needed, without maintaining a constant handle to it.  Kinda handy
	for finding the first one of objects that may have sibling types,
	but not so much.

	* MapHandlerChild class has the findAndInit(Object) and
	findAndUndo(Object) method added.  This lets you override the
	findAndInit(Object) method in MapHandlerChild subclasses, and be
	able to provide the super class with objects from the MapHandler,
	too.  Previously, this was not possible because using the iterator
	clears it and it couldn't be used in different places.  Likewise,
	the findAndUndo(Object) method was added for objects being removed
	from the MapHandler.

	* The OMCircle was modified to handle rotation! The rotation
	angle, in radians, can defined with setRotationAngle(double), with
	zero being due West.  Positive and negative values can be used.

	The EditableOMGraphic doesn't really handle the rotation angle
	completely.  You can't modify the angle at all, and the grab
	points for the OMCircle actually show up where they would be with
	a rotation angle of zero.  But, adjusting the position of the grab
	points does modify the dimensions of the rotated OMCircle, and you
	can move it around.  The EditableOMGraphic has commented-out code
	to render the points properly, but the MouseEvent locations have
	to be translated in order for them to be effective.  Releasing
	this class as it is was the lessor evil of the alternatives.

	--- This part is important!! ---

	The rotation was accomplished by changing the internal
	representation of the OMCircle to be based on java.awt.Shape
	objects, and then using AffineTransforms on the shape during
	generation.  This actually made the render and distance methods
	become very generic, not relying on rendertype or what kind of
	shape was being rendered.  This will be a change that all
	OMGraphics will be headed toward very soon.

	Also, the OMCircle has a new Shape[] getShapes() method, which
	lets you get the generated shape objects and then use them for
	some spatial analysis operations that the java.awt.Shape interface
	provides.  This is really powerful, and look for this to become
	part of the generic OMGraphic API.  This method returns an array
	of shapes because in some small world situations (really zoomed
	out) there are multiple Shape objects that are used to represent
	the graphic wrapping around the other side of the earth.

	* Added the GoToMenu, which lets you saved named Projections,
	consisting of projection type, center location and scale.  You can
	add to the list dynamically, and the locations get saved to the
	openmap.properties file when a map is saved.  You can also add
	locations by modifying the properties for the GoToMenu class.

	* Added the Esri plugin package, submitted by Doug Van Auken.
	This package includes and EsriLayer and EsriPlugIn, and has
	support for reading and writing shape files (shp) and their
	supporting files (shx and dbf).  The EsriPlugIn was added to take
	advantage of the SwingWorker in PlugInLayer, and also has code
	that displays the contents of the dbf attribute file in the layer
	palette, and will highlight graphics on the map corresponding to
	any selections in the table.  Likewise, and graphics on the map
	selected (in Gestures mouse mode) will hightlight entries in the
	table.

	There will be more improvements coming to the package soon.  Among
	them, support for sorting the table, use of the BinaryBufferedFile
	for buffered input, and increased support for distinctive coloring
	for individual graphic.

	The package also contains a sample applet and application to
	demonstrate how to use the different capabilities of the
	components.

	* OMGraphic has the get*Color methods undeprecated.  If the Paint
	objects used are not Color objects, null is returned.  This was
	done to save casting trouble.

	* OMText was updated to paint the boundary rectangle correctly.

	* The DistanceMouseMode was modified to be a PropertyConsumer, and
	it's parameters can be set in the openmap.properties file for
	customized configuration - units, etc.

	* The ControlMenu was modified to let you toggle the ToolPanel on
	and off.

	* Bill Huff submitted several memory cleanups in LayerPane and
	LayersPanel, to help with GC'ing layers that were removed from the
	application.

	* The NavigatePanel was updated to provide methods to set the
	coordinates the map goes to when the center button of the rosette
	is pressed.  By default, it still goes to the starting
	coordinates.

	* The OMToolSet has properties that can be used to set which
	components are visible on the ToolPanel - the NavigatePanel,
	ZoomPanel and ScalePanel are optional, but on by default.

	* The ImageServer now has a main method that lets you pass it an
	openmap.properties file, and it kicks out an image file.  You need
	to have a couple of extra properties defined, like what formatter
	to use, in the properties file.

	* DMSLatLonPoint longitude wrapping bug fixed.

	* The status lights of the InformationDelegator where made to be
	buttons that bring up the palette of the corresponding layer's
	palette.

	* The TerrainLayer's LOSGenerator algorithm was improved via a
	submission from Mark Wigmore.

2001-08-23 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com
	* OpenMap 4.3 released.
	
2001-08-23 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Changed the WebBrowser class to use the File methods for
	creating unique and temporary files for browser display.

	* Added the MIFLoader improvements submitted by Scott Nevin from
	Agilent, which allows the loader to handle lines.

	* Made the Location showName and showLocation variables be true by
	default, so that Locations will show up as expected.  The
	LayerHandlers have been updated to set these to be false so the
	layer settings will work as expected.

	* Updated the raster Location objects to use the horizontal label
	buffer, so that the text location gets updated properly when the
	entire location changes.

	* Added a progress bar for the DTEDCoverageManager, so progress
	can be seen when the DTEDCoverageLayer is bulding the coverage file.

	* Updated the DayNightLayer to be able to have the overlay time set.

	* Took out the supposed XWorkaround from windows and mac
	environments.  The coordinate clipping changed how the map was
	being rendered at some large scales.

	* Added the OMDrawingToolLauncher, which calls the DrawingTool
	with setting to create new OMGraphics.  It's a Tool, so it can be
	enabled by clicking on the pencil icon.

	It uses the BeanContext to find all the EditToolLoaders, which
	know how to use EditableOMGraphics to manipulate OMGraphics.  It
	also finds all DrawingToolRequestors, which are components able to
	receive OMGraphics.  The OMDrawingToolLauncher lets you choose
	which component will receive the finished graphic.

	Added the DrawingToolLayer as an example of how to catch graphics
	from the OMDrawingToolLauncher.

	* Added support for creating and editing polygons and polylines.

2001-07-27 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added a workaround for Applets trying to access data that was
	being stored in its own jar file.  See the
	com.bbn.openmap.io.AppletDataNugget class for more information.

	* Fixed a bug in the
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.util.LayerUtils.getResourceOrFileOrURL
	method, where files were not being handled properly for Windows
	file systems.

	* Fixed a bug in the EarthImagePlugIn that was coloring space, in
	the Orthographic projection, to the color of the center pixel.

	* Fixed a memory leak in the VPF package, started by the
	FeatureClassInfo object.  Thanks to Tom Peel for finding this and
	reporting it.

2001-07-12 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>
	* OpenMap 4.2.1 released.
	
2001-07-11 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Fixed problems with 'make install' with respect to the previous
	changes in the share directory structure.

	* Updated the WMSPlugIn with changes submitted by Christof Krug,
	with the proper TRANSPARENT request parameters and other changes.

	* Added statements to the PlugIn package that says that the PlugIn
	is responsible for generating its OMGraphics.  Updated some of the
	PlugIns to do that.

	* Modifed MakeToc in the RPF package, and some of the other RPF
	components to make MakeToc a little more robust with older files.
	Added output statments to indicated when runtime options should be used.

	* Added an openmap.Debug property to the PropertyHandler, which
	takes a list of debug tokens and adds them to the Debug
	Hashtable.  This turns those Debug statements on throughout the
	code.  It's the same thing as adding -Ddebug.*token* to the start
	command, except now you can add an openmap.Debug=*token* in the properties.

2001-06-19	Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>
	* OpenMap 4.2 released.
	
2001-06-18 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.io package, and moved all the I/O
	classes from com.bbn.openmap.util into it.  BinaryFile was also
	reworked.  This is BIG news.  BinaryFile now uses a new
	InputReader class to access data files, instead of using a
	RandomAccessFile object.  There are three new InputReaders:
	FileInputReader, JarInputReader, and StreamInputReader.  A
	BinaryFile (and the BinaryBufferedFile) can be used to access a
	local file, a file contained in a jar file, or a URL.  

	The constructor for a BinaryFile takes a string argument which can
	be an absolute path to a file, a relative path to a file, or a
	URL.  The BinaryFile will use the CLASSPATH to find the file for a
	relative path.  If the file can be found on the local file system,
	a FileInputReader (RandomAccessFile) will be used internally.  If
	the file is found in a jar file (the path from the internal root
	of the jar should be used), the JarInputReader will be used.  For
	paths starting with 'http:', the StreamInputReader will be used.

	The Shape, RPF, VPF and DTED packages have all been modified to
	use the BinaryFile, and this data can now be accessed in a variety
	of ways.

	There are some issues: Windows users have to use forward slashes
	in their paths (/), even for local files.  We're still trying to
	figure out how to get applets to use data stored in a separate jar
	file in the codebase - but unpackaged data in the codebase works.
	Some packages may need to be optimized for better network
	performance - they were written for random access, so they may not
	be so efficient when it comes to dealing with streams.
	
	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.plugin package, replacing the
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.plugin package.  Plugins have been
	redefined, and are the easiest way to get data on the map.
	Plugins must implement the com.bbn.openmap.plugin.PlugIn
	interface, but classes that extend the AbstractPlugIn can provide
	data with only one method being written - that method takes a
	projection and provides an OMGraphicList.  PlugIns are an object
	that hook up to a PlugInLayer, or to a server, or any other object
	that needs an OMGraphicList.  PlugIns can be written
	to receive MouseEvents and/or provide a GUI, and they can work
	with the BeanContext to contact other objects in the application.

	* Modified the actions of the OMDrawingTool.  When edits/creations
	are completed on the graphic, clicking on the map brings up a
	popup menu with options on what to do with the graphic.

	* Fixed the LLXY projection, which happens to be the SRS EPS 4326
	projection that can be used with a OGC Web Map Server.	

	* Updated the LayerUtils.getResourceOrFileOrURL method, so it
	doesn't break on Windows file URL pathnames.
	
	* ProfileGenerator in the TerrainLayer has been updated to display
	the profile image in a JFrame, instead of trying to create a
	temporary file to send to the browser.  You loose the ability to
	save the image this way, but it makes the layer compatible with
	any environment OpenMap is running in.

	* Int the RPF package: Fixed bug in MakeToc that wouldn't let you
	create a A.TOC from multiple RPF directories.  Commented out the
	code that checks for updated RPF directories.  With the inclusion
	of the new BinaryFile code, this gets to be really cumbersome.
	This will be replaced soon with enchanced RPF directory
	management.

	* Fixed a bug in the LocationLayer so that MouseMoved events get
	passed through if they aren't consumed.
	
	* Added methods to DTEDFrame so you can ask it for an image of its
	contents without the DTEDCacheHandler in the way.  Also, if you
	run DTEDFrame on a frame file, it will bring up a window with that
	image of the data inside.
	
	* Created the com.bbn.openmap.proj.Length class, which provides a
	class standard for Length units, and coversion methods between a
	given unit type and radians.  Modified the MouseModes, OMGraphics
	and Link package to use the Length class.

	* Modified the PropertyHandler to look for the given properties
	file in the CodeBase when running in an Applet environment.  This
	only happens if it hasn't found any properties elsewhere.

	* Modified the Windows environment to use the XWindowsWorkaround
	algorithm for pre-clipping OMGraphics, which gets rid of the
	zoom-in delay on vector graphics.

2001-03-15 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>

	* OpenMap 4.1.1 released.
	
2001-03-15 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Fixed memory leak within LayerHandler.  Layers were being
	referenced by the LayerPane after they were removed from the
	LayerHandler, and not being gc'd.

	* Added getName() to the projection classes, which provides their ID.

	* Fixed link in OMPoly java doc.

	* Fixed bug for initial limits of bounding polygon.  This was
	causing more data than needed to be sent back by the LinkServer.
	Thanks to Marc Bucciarelli for finding this and sending the fix.

	* Added the capability in the SimpleHttpImageServer and
	ImageServerUtils to be able to handle a background color request
	(BGCOLOR) and transparency settings (TRANSPARENCY) in SHIS
	requests.  These variables are in compliance with the OpenGIS
	Consortium Web Mapping Server specification.  Another compliance
	change is the background color for the SHIS maps is now white -
	you have to specify the color you want if you want it to be different.

	* Added methods to objects in the image package that let you set
	the colormodel for BufferedImages.

	* Fixed bug in quadtree Rect and Node, where the distance
	algorithm wasn't correct.

2001-02-27 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>
	
	* OpenMap 4.1 released.
	
2001-02-26 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added a package name to the com.bbn.openmap.examples.crew
	example.

	* Modified the PropertyHandler to use the openmap/share directory
	by default to look for openmap.properties, and it adds the share
	directory to the classpaths the Environment knows about.  If you
	are using the openmap directory in your classpath, then files and
	other resources will be found in the share directory
	automatically.  If you are using the openmap.jar file, then
	resources will be found in the share directory, but files need to
	have share/ added in front of their names (for shape files, for
	example).

	* Modified the Environment and projection objects to handle the
	custom background color a little better.
	
2001-02-23 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added a ToolTip display ability to the InformationDelegator.
	The Layer has convience functions to show and hide tool tips on
	the map, and the InfoDisplayListener interface had methods added
	to accomidate tool tip requests.  This was inspired by another
	Colin Mummery submission, but slightly modified.

	* Modifed the DrawingTool API.  Components are no longer passed in
	a request to create or edit an OMGraphic.  Instead, a
	DrawingToolRequestor interface has been defined, where the
	requstor will be notfied when an OMGraphic is completed.  The
	OMGraphic is provided at this time too, in addition to be provided
	at request time.  Methods were also added the DrawingTool
	interface to supress the GUI from appearing, which will restrict
	the modifications of the graphic attributes.

	* Added more improvements to the VPFLayer where, when
	VPFLayer.searchByFeatures is set to true, different feature types
	can be colored individually.  The palette also provides an
	interface to change those settings on a feature by feature basis.

	* Added an ETOPOJarLayer from John Watts from nextjet.com.  Also
	added his improvements to the Mercator and Orthographic projections.

	* Added the MapHandlerChild abstract class, which shows all the
	methods and the BeanContextChildSupport object that are needed to
	create an object that uses the MapHandler to find other objects.

	* Added Colin Mummery's MapInfo Layer, at com.bbn.openmap.layer.mif.

	* Added the build.xml file, which is a build file for the ant
	package available at http://jakarta.apache.org/ant.  Ant is
	great.  It is a cross-platform Java project build tool, and is
	easy to install and use.  Highly recommended.

2001-02-06 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Fixed LocationLayer bug where search direction on the graphic
	list was the same as rendering direction, when it should have been
	opposite, so that graphics on top are found first.

	* Fixed the Makefile structure to include the drawing tool package.

	* The MouseDelegator had a bug fix installed to prevent a null
	pointer exception when setActive was called without a current MouseMode.

	* Updated the VPFLayer and vpf package components with several
	improvements.  Multiple coverage types can be handled on a single
	layer.  With the VPFLayer.searchByFeatures property set to true,
	the CoverageTable uses the Feature Tables and the Thematic Index
	to find features, which avoids a problem exposed by the DNC
	database where the tile data doesn't contain feature type
	information.  With searchByFeatures set to true, different feature
	types can be rendered individually.  The VPF components were also
	tuned for better performance and memory management.  Fixed a bug
	with the old VPF paradigm where skip arrays in the warehouse were
	not the same across VPF paths, and it affected rendering.
	Resetting the warehouse skip arrays between paths fixed this.  

2001-01-08 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the ProjectionStack, which is a projection listener that
	remembers projections to reset to the MapBean when triggered.
	Listens to ProjectionStackTriggers (ProjectionStackTool) to tell
	it to go back and forth through the stack as applicable.

2000-12-22 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com

	* OpenMap 4.0 and OpenMap 3.7 released.
	
2000-12-19 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Modified the ShapeLayer and ESRI graphic objects to use the
	DrawingAttributes object for rendering parameters, and added the
	DrawingAttributes GUI to the ShapeLayer palette.  You can alter
	the appearance of the ShapeLayer graphics at runtime.

2000-12-18 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.layer.terrain layer, which provides a
	LOS mask and path elevation tool.  This layer will be modified in
	future versions of OpenMap.

	* Added a URLDecoder to the SimpleHttpImageServer, so it can
	handle HTML encoding of a map request string.

	* Added a method (setAction(boolean)) to the MouseModes, which
	lets it know when it has been made active or inactive.

	* Added the PaintListener interface to the com.bbn.openmap.event
	package.  The PaintListener interface can be used when a object
	needs to know when another object has been painted.  For instance,
	the OMDrawingTool is a PaintListener to the MapBean, so it knows
	when to update the edited Graphic in case it's about to be
	over-painted.

	* Added the PropertyConsumer interface, which lets the
	ComponentFactory know that an object should receive the properties
	from the PropertyHandler when it is created.  The PropertyConsumer
	interface also a method that let an object describe what
	properties can be received by it, and a method to get properties
	from it to describe the current state of the object.  This is in
	anticipation of the creation of a editor that will allow for the
	runtime creation and configuration of layers and other objects,
	and for the creation of openmap.properties files, which will
	essential be saving a map for later viewing.

	* Modified the VPFLayer to present the new DrawingAttributes GUI
	in its palette.  This lets you change the display parameters of
	the layer graphics at runtime.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.tools.drawing package, which contains
	the DrawingTool interface, and the OMDrawingTool implementation of
	that interface.  The OMDrawingTool is a mechanism that interprets
	user gestures to create or modify OMGraphics.  

	There are new objects in the com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics package to
	help out with this process, centered on the EditableOMGraphic
	class.  An EditableOMGraphic is a wrapper class that knows how to
	interpret MouseEvents to initialize or change the location
	parameters of an OMGraphic that it contains.  

	The EditableOMGraphic uses GrabPoints that can be moved or set.
	When a GrabPoint is moved, the EditableOMGraphic knows how to
	translate the GrabPoint location to a OMGraphic parameter.
	GrabPoints come in different flavors - HorizontalGrabPoints can
	only be moved left-right, VerticalGrabPoints can only be moved
	up-down, and OffsetGrabPoints can maintain a constant distance
	from other GrabPoints.  GrabPoints can be shared between
	EditableOMGraphics, in case you want the movement of a GrabPoint
	to modify the parameters of more than one OMGraphic.

	The EditableOMGraphic also uses a state machine containing a
	series of states that direct actions resulting from MouseEvents.
	The com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics.editable contains the new
	LineStateMachine and its states.  This state machine is used by
	the first instantiated class of the abstract EditableOMGraphic, the
	EditableOMLine.  Other EditableOMGraphic instances are
	forthcoming, to manipulate other OMGraphic types.

	The OMDrawingTool uses EditToolLoaders, which provide information
	to the DrawingTool on which EditableOMGraphic to use for a class
	name, or OMGraphic.  The OMDrawingTool has two main methods that a
	layer or other component calls - create(classname), or
	edit(OMGraphic).  Both calls return an OMGraphic that is going to
	be manipulated by the DrawingTool.  The DrawingTool handles the
	presentation of the OMGraphic as it's being modified, and becomes
	the active MouseMode.  When the DrawingTool is dismissed, the
	calling layer or component already has the OMGraphic, so no
	further action is required programmatically.
	
	The DemoLayer contains addition to its palette that demonstrate
	the OMDrawingTool as it stands.

	The OMDrawingTool is not a DrawingLayer.  A DrawingLayer will be
	created for the next release using the OMDrawingTool.
	
	* Modified the DrawingAttributes object so that it contains a
	simple GUI to modify its contents (line color, fill color, select
	color, line width, and some line dash selections).  Uses the
	OMColorChooser, which extends the JColorChooser to allow
	transparency adjustment for the color as well.  Added the
	LineChoice, LineChoiceComboBox and DashedLineComboBox to aid the
	DrawingAttributes GUI interface.  Also created the
	GraphicAttributes object, which extends the DrawingAttributes
	object to allow modification of line type and render type of an
	OMGraphic.

	* Modifed the com.bbn.openmap.layer.rpf.RpfFrame so that it
	contains the subframe decompression code that used to reside in
	the RpfFrameCacheHandler.  Also added an image viewer to the
	RpfFrame that lets you see the image it contains - just run the
	class.  Removed the RpfLayer pop-up window that notifies the user
	that the RPF layer requires the CADRG projection.  The InfoLine of
	the InformationDelegator displays the information instead.

	* Packaged OpenMap 3.7, which is an OpenMap 3.6.2 package with all
	the code that requires jdk 1.2 removed.  This package should
	compile without modification with jdk 1.1.X.

2000-10-23 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.image.SimpleHttpImageServer, with the
	MapRequestHandler object and a bunch of modifications to the
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.util.http package.  The
	SimpleHttpImageServer responds to GET and POST commands,
	requesting an image.  The format for the request is the same as
	the OpenGIS Web Mapping Server request, but we have additional
	parameters to handle some OpenMap-specific parameters.  This is a
	work in progress, and will grow to become OGC compliant.  For now,
	it allows you to run a simple web server that kicks back images.

	* Added the PropertyHandler, which is a component responsible for
	managing properties which affect the map.  When told, it looks for
	properties in three places, and overwrites the properties
	accordingly - the Resources, the OpenMap config directory (passed
	in as an argument), and in the user's home directory.

	The role of the PropertyHandler is important, especially in the
	BeanContext world.  It can be told to look for a property called
	"openmap.components", where the value is a space separated list of
	marker names, much like the openmap.properties model for the
	layers.  The PropertyHandler can take that list and use the
	ComponentFactory to create objects (defined by the
	markerName.class properties) to add to the Bean Context.  If the
	object created is a PropertyConsumer, the PropertyHandler will be
	used to provide the new object with properties.

	The PropertyHandler also allows for an "openmap.include" property,
	which allows you to define a list of marker names for URLs.  These
	URLs, defined by the markerName.URL property, provide a way to
	have a property file read and its values loaded BEFORE the current
	openmap.properties file is loaded.  This lets the current
	properties override anything in the include properties file.

	You'll notice these changes have a profound effect on the ease in
	which you can create applications.  If a component handles the
	Bean Context correctly, and is wiring itself up to other objects
	it needs via those methods, then you can add the component in the
	properties file, and that change will be reflected within the
	application without recompilation.  The MouseDelegator looks for
	MouseModes, the LayerHandler looks for layers, etc., so that these
	additions are pretty simple.  The ToolPanel looks for objects
	implementing the Tool interface, so that its GUI will be added to
	the panel below the MenuBar.  The MenuBar looks for MenuBarMenus
	to add to itself, so adding/changing menus is pretty easy, too.


2000-10-19 Prakash Manghwani <pmanghwa@bbn.com>
	
	* OpenMap components now use Bean Containment and Services
	protocol, popularly know as BeanContext.  The components look for 
	services and objects that it needs.  

	* Modified OpenMap in com.bbn.openmap.app package so that it
	demonstrates the ease of creating a reconfigurable Mapping
	application from a properties file.

	* Added new context enabled GUI extensible widgets that can be
	added to OpenMap Mapping application from properties file thereby
	providing the user with a choice of selecting only the GUI widgets
	it needs.
	
2000-08-24 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>

	* OpenMap 3.6.2 released.
	
2000-08-23 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Included the upgraded DistanceMouseMode as submitted by Ringo Wathelet.

	* Added the UTMPoint and DMSLatLonPoint, as a contribution from
	Colin Mummery.  Also included the Ellipsoid class in the
	projection package.

	* Added a redraw button to the VPFLayer.
	
2000-08-22 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the ArgParser class to the utils directory, which is a
	very simple attempt at parsing String[] argv arguments and assigning
	string values to certain option keywords.

	* Ported the code to create a A.TOC file to java, and it resides
	in a class called com.bbn.openmap.layer.rpf.MakeToc.  Lets you
	create A.TOCs with absolute file paths, which allows you to create
	a single A.TOC for multiple RPF directories without merging the
	directories.

	* Fixed a couple bugs in the LayerHandler, that didn't update the
	LayersPanel properly when a layer was deleted from the available
	layers list.  Now check for null edit button before trying to add
	it to the LayersMenu.

2000-08-08 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>

	* OpenMap 3.6.1 released.
	
2000-08-03 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the openmap.BackgroundColor property, which lets you set
	the color of the "ocean" for the MapBean.  If it's not set, then
	the ol' default blue is used.

	* Added the DistanceMouseMode, which was a code submission from
	Ringo Wathelet from the DSTO in Australia.

	* Fixed the quadtree rectangle test for bounds checking, thanks to
	code supplied by Paul Tomblin.  Michael Los sent in the changes to
	make the quadtree classes serializable.

	* Added a RpfLayer redraw button on the palette, to redraw the
	data with a transparancy change.

	* Created an OverviewMapHandler, which manages another MapBean
	that listens to a source MapBean to show a map at a different
	scale.  The OverviewMapHandler lets you set it's layers, the
	MouseMode to use (if desired) and a status layer that lets you
	draw status graphics on the map.  The default status layer simply
	draws a box on the map reflecting the coverage of the main map.

	* Changed the appearance of the OpenMap application, with new
	icons and buttons to bring up the LayersPanel and OverviewMap.
	The mouse modes are now shown with a pop-up menu.

	* Created the com.bbn.openmap.layer.util.DrawingAttributes object,
	which can read Properties to create colors and other Java2D
	drawing attributes.  OMGraphics parameters can be loaded directly
	from a DrawingAttributes object.

	* Modified the VPFLayer so that you can specify how you want the
	graphics represented.  You can specify line, text, select, and
	fill colors, as well as line dash patterns and images to use for
	area fill patterns.

	* Further modified the inner workings of the RpfLayer.  Fixed a
	bug with the way cached subframes were allocated for new
	subframes, and fixed a couple subtle memory leaks.

	* Overhauled the LayerHandler, making it the central object
	managing all Layer objects.  The LayersMenu and LayersPanel listen
	to the LayerHandler for information about what layers are
	available.  The visibility of the layer now determines if the
	layer is added to the MapBean to be part of the map, and the
	LayersManu and LayersPanel components listen to the layer
	Component visibility status to list if a layer is part of the map
	or not.  The Layer now has a slight hack in them that keep track
	of ComponentListeners, and follow through to the listeners to let
	them know if the layer has been hidden (setVisible(false)).

	* Added the etopo layer package, which was submitted from Joel
	A.  Rand.  It displays the ETOPO world elevation data set, and
	provides a really cool view of the world.

2000-08-01 Bill Euerle <wjeuerle@bbn.com>

	* Fix a bug that prevented DTEDFrame objects from getting garbage
 	collected, limited the frame cache size, and fixed an off-by-one
 	bug that caused an extra row of frames to get loaded.  The cache
	memory changes were a result of a suggestion from Davis Gillespie,
	formerly from General Dynamics.

2000-07-05 Bill Euerle <wjeuerle@bbn.com>

	* Removed deprecated OMGraphic methods setGraphicType(int) and
 	getGraphicType.  setGraphicType didn't make much sense, and (obj
 	instanceof OMBitmap) can be used in place of the second method.
 	Deprecated the OMGraphic constructors that took a graphictype, and
 	added new constructors that don't take a graphic type.  Although
 	now unused, the GRAPHICTYPE_* constants in OMGraphic will stay
 	around for the forseeable future.

2000-06-01 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Released OpenMap 3.5

2000-06-01 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>

	* Added thinned VPF area and edge data to the share/ directory as
	an alternative to the existing DCW shape files in that directory.
	
2000-05-31 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added a palette option to the RpfLayer to limit the chart
	selection to the one currently selected.  If you find a chart type
	you like, you can engage the lock, and only charts of that
	particular type will be displayed.

2000-05-25 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>
	
	* Removed the csvLocation package.  It has been replaced by the
	location/csv package.

	* Updated the ImageGenerator code with bug fixes and hardened the
	thread model.

	* Updated the ImageServer to have a method that uses the
	ProjectionPainter interface.  This will help with some of the
	threading problems reported with the ImageServer.

	* Added the ProjectionPainter interface.  The ProjectionPainter
	takes a Projection and a java.awt.Graphics object, and renders the
	applicable OMGraphics onto the java.awt.Graphics map.  The layers
	have been updated to implement this interface, providing a path to
	avoid the Swing threading model that the Layers usually use.

	* Added a File->Save As->JPEG option to the MenuPanel.  You can
	save the current OpenMap image as a JPEG.  You can also modify the
	MenuPanel to use other ImageFormatters, too.

2000-05-17 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Modified the arrowhead output statements to be Debug statements,
	instead of constant output.

	* Added border fix to OpenMap applet as suggested by Mark
	Bucciarelli.
	
2000-05-16 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Modified the RpfLayer to not burn cpu cycles on the
	RpfCoverageTool if the tool is not in use.  Changed the coverage
	property so that the tool is active by default, accessable via the
	RpfLayer palette.

2000-04-05 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added methods in the ImageServer that lets it act as the
	ImageReceiver.  This lets you ask it for an image directly,
	instead of using it to load an ImageReceiver.

2000-04-01 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Fixed timing bug in ImageGenerator that caused it to hang when
	the same projection was provided twice in a row.

Thu Mar 30 12:38:32 2000  <wjeuerle@HAYSTACK>

	* omGraphics/OMText2D.java: added an OMGraphic that supports
 	rotated text.  [Requires the Java2D API.]

2000-03-30 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Modified the OMGraphicList select() and deselect() method
	behaviors - they now call selectAll() and deselectAll().

	* Added the ArcCalc object to the com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics.util
	package, which lets you add arcs to OMLines that are set with XY
	coordinates.
	

Fri Mar 24 12:41:58 2000  <wjeuerle@HAYSTACK>

	* Deprecate OMGraphic.setGraphicType(int) and
 	OMGraphic.getGraphicType().  instanceof returns the same type of
 	information as getGraphicType(), and setGraphicType() doesn't
 	really change the type (OMPoly, OMCircle, ...) of a graphic, so
 	its somewhat useless.  OMGraphic.graphicType was made private
 	(previously protected) so it can also go away when set/get go
 	away.

2000-03-09 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Modifed the RPF package.  Fixed the transparancy problem, the
	layer now responds correctly to transparancy changes and
	settings.  The RpfFrameCacheHandler now tests for colortable
	reusability based on the TOC entry number, instead of the map
	type, since there is the possibility, with MM map types, that the
	chart designator may be inaccurate, especially with MM map charts
	that represent several different map chart types.

	* Modified the OMRaster to handle transparancy correctly.

	* Modified the image package, namely the ImageMaster, the
	ImageServer, and the ImageGenerator.  The ImageMaster and the
	ImageServer now reuse layers across ImageServers, when they can.
	The ImageServer now reuses the ImageGenerator.  In addition, the
	ImageServer can have it's layer array modified, and requests can
	be made with a bit mask representing which layers should be turned
	on/off for the map image.

2000-02-28 Don Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Released OpenMap 3.4

2000-02-25 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the mapIt example, a contribution that's pretty similar to
	the ImageMaster class.

	* Added the nexrad/NextradLayer, which is a contribution that
	draws the rainfall over an area as stored in a nexrad file.

2000-02-24 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* OMRasterObject was modified to trim unused pixels from itself
	before upscaling itself, instead of relying on the windowing
	system to clip the unused image.

	* Added the CSVInfoFile to the com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape
	package, which can read in and parse a csv file created from a
	shapefile's .dbf file.  This CSVInfoFile is used by the areas
	package.  Also, the shape graphics have been modified to handle
	Java 2D drawing attributes, and the SpatialIndex object can be
	given an ImageIcon to use for Point graphics.

	* Modified the OMGraphic2D objects to handle fill patterns, using
	TexturePaint objects.  Also made them keep track of the
	modifications they make to the java Graphics object so that non-2D
	OMGraphics don't pick up those patterns and strokes by mistake.

	* Created the com.bbn.openmap.layer.location package, which takes
	the place of the deprecated csvLocation package, and isolates how
	the locations get created.  Added the AbstractLocationHandler,
	thanks to a suggestion from a user.  This package was actually
	included in the last OpenMap delivery, unannounced.  The location
	package has the option of working with the DeclutterMatrix.

	* Modified the DeclutterMatrix to work more accurately with text.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.image.BufferedImageHelper and
	com.bbn.openmap.image.ImageHelper, which assist in creating and
	manipulating image pixels, especially BufferedImages.  Moved the
	JPEGHelper to the image package from the util package.

	* Took out some funky alignment statements from some of the GUI
	tools, making them align correctly.

	* Modified the RpfLayer to not query the RpfFrameProvider for
	coverage tool information when the coverage tool was not being
	used.  Fixed a problem reading in CIB A.TOC files from NIMA.  The
	directory name lengths are incorrectly listed in the file, and the
	files where not being found.  Added the indexed image capability
	to the RpfFrameProvider interface, which really helps speed in the
	com.bbn.openmap.layer.rpf.corba implementation for LANS.

	* Added the capability for the OMGraphicList to be able to
	read/write serialized graphics to/from streams.  Helps the
	CacheLayer.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.shape.areas package, which lets you
	associate a key and a name from a column in a csv file to the
	graphics in a shapefile.  The AreaHandler allows you to ask for
	all the graphics in the shapefile that have the same key, as well
	as define special drawing attributes for specific graphics in the
	openmap.properties file (or any other set of properties sent to
	it).  The AreaShapeLayer uses the AreaHandler, and can respond to
	gestures by displaying the defined name of the graphic in the
	information line when the mouse is passed over it.  The drawing
	attributes for the graphics can include using an image to set a
	texture for the fill pattern of a graphic - this requires JDK 1.2.

	* Modified the com.bbn.openmap.util.Debug object to be able to
	direct output and error statements to various places, including
	log files.  Modified several components and layers to write their
	debug statements to the Debug.output() method, and their error
	statements to the Debug.error() method.  More changes of this type
	to the source code is needed - just didn't get around to changing
	it all.

	* Added the openmap/contrib directory, which holds code that
	OpenMap components need that we didn't write.  Added the Acme
	(http://www.acme.com) image encoders for JPEG, GIF and PPM image
	formats to this directory.  Added the ImageFomatters to the
	com.bbn.openmap.image package that use the Acme encoders.

	* Added the ImageServer and ImageMaster, which help create
	specific images.  The ImageServer manages the ImageGenerator and
	the output of the image.  The ImageMaster uses ImageServers to
	define what you want on a map, the image format you want it in,
	and where you want it written when it's done.

1999-11-03 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>

	* Released OpenMap 3.3.5
	
1999-11-01 George Keith <gkeith@bbn.com>

	* Added CacheLayer.java to layers directory.  CacheLayer.java will
 	read and display serialized omGraphics from a file specified in
 	the properties.

1999-09-30 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com.

	* Released Openmap 3.3.4
	
1999-09-29 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Updated memory management for the RPF package.  The subframe
	caching works better in a memory-restrictive environment.

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.image package.  Includes the
 	ImageServer, which uses an openmap.properties file and a
 	projection to tell an ImageGenerator to create an image.  This
 	image is in the format specified by the ImageFormatter.

	* Added the LayerHandler to the gui package.  Layers can be added
	and removed on the fly.
	
1999-09-07 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the corba package for a RpfFrameProvider.  Included is the
 	Corba RpfFrameProvider client, the Corba RpfFrameProvider server,
 	and the idl that defines their interface.  The Rpf Subframe data is
 	transferred betweent the client and server in JPEG format.  A
 	CorbaRpfLayer was created to add a palette widget that lets you
 	control the jpeg image quality, and thus size, during
 	client-server transfer.  The JPEG encoding and Decoding requires
	the com.sun.image.codec.jpeg package.  Thie new package has only
	been tested on jdk1.2 with Visibroker 3.3.  The jdk1.2 rt.jar file 
	had the CORBA classes removed.

	* Overhauled RPF layer with a new separation of subframe caches
	and frame caches.  Introduced the RpfFrameProvider interface,
	which isolates the RPF frame cache.  The RpfFrameProvider can be a 
	local version of the RpfFrameCache handler, or can also be some
	sort of server.  All parts of the package have changed, and are
	incompatable with past interfaces.

1999-08-25 Bill Mackiewicz <bmackiew@bbn.com>

	* Released OpenMap 3.3.3
	
1999-08-17 Bill Euerle <wjeuerle@bbn.com>

	* Added additional projections to that support views (projections
	whose parameters are recalculated when panning the map)

1999-08-06 Allan Doyle <adoyle@stout.bbn.com>

	* Improved CSVLocationLayer to read values from a
	URL.  (file:/foo.csv or http://foo.com/foo.csv)

1999-08-05 Allan Doyle <adoyle@bbn.com>

	* Incorporated BufferedMapBean changes to speed up refresh and
	fixed a NullPointerException when it's used in a
	JInternalFrame.  Thanks to Joe Warzecha at LLNL.

1999-07-29 Thomas Mitchell <tmitchel@stout.bbn.com>

	* Added share/omapplet.html as a sample html file for running
	OpenMap as an applet via the Java Plug-in.

	* Added FAQ section 4, OpenMap as an Applet discussing the hows
	and whys of running OpenMap as an Applet.

1999-07-21 Allan Doyle <adoyle@bbn.com>
	* Added .shadowX and .shadowY properties to ShapeLayer.java.
	This allows you to make snazzy maps with an offset shadow
	underneath.
	
1999-07-20 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the OMgrid graphic object, which, like the other
 	OMGraphics, handles Lat/Lon grids, X/Y grids, and Lat/Lon offset
 	grids.  Rendering to the screen depends on objects that implement
 	the OMGridGenerator interface.  A couple of generators have been
 	added to the source tree - one assumes that the grid contents are
 	ARGB colors, and a couple others assume that the contents are
 	elevations.  The grid can also hold other graphic objects.

1999-04-19 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Fixed a bug in RpfTocHandler that caused the A.TOC file section
 	to be read incorrectly.

1999-04-19  <culliney@bohemia>

	* Merged patches from various contributors (thanks!) to DTED
	 and DayNight code.

	* Fixed some problems with ScaleFilterLayer and DateLayer.

	* Added BufferedShapeLayer for nominal speed gain.

1999-04-05 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the CSVLocationLayer.  This layer lets you give it a
	comma-separated value file, listing locations with their latitudes 
	and longitudes on each row.  The latitude, longitude and location
	name column locations have to be given to the layer via the
	openmap.properties file.  The layer can be extended to let the
	locations display additional detailed information through a
	browser when a locaiton is clicked upon.

1999-04-05 Bill Euerle <wjeuerle@bbn.com>

	* Modified VPF code to move more of the rendering decisions into
	the VPFGraphicWarehouse interface, to allow more flexibility to
	choose what to draw, and how to draw it.

	* Modified VPF code to allow multiple paths to data directories.
	
1999-04-05  <culliney@bohemia>

	* Updated the openmap.properties file.  You will want to merge the
 	options in this file with the openmap.properties in your home
 	directory.

1999-03-18 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the RPF layer to the openmap tree.  RPF is the National
	Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) format for raster products, like 
	CADRG and CIB.  The RPF layer handles these products, displaying
	them in the OpenMap CADRG projection.

	* Added the DayNightlayer, which shades the part of the earth that
 	is experiencing nighttime.  There are many parameters that can be
 	adjusted through the openmap.properties file.  See the
 	DayNightLayer documentation for more information.

	* Modified the Graticule Layer to display latitude and longitude
	line labels, draw one and five degree lines when the scale is
	large enough to require them, and draws different line types in
	different colors.  These parameters are adjustable through the
	openmap.properties file.  See the GraticuleLayer documentation for 
	more information.
	
1999-03-16  <culliney@bohemia>

	* Deprecated OMColor.  Two constructors incorrectly override the
 	Java 2 java.awt.Color.  OMColor was only useful to support
 	alpha-valued images under JDK 1.1.  You shouldn't use it.  Instead
 	use regular java.awt.Colors or use the Java version-neutral
 	com.bbn.openmap.util.ColorFactory to create colors.

1999-02-22 Aaron Culliney <aculline@blatz.bbn.com>

	* Added Java 2D API OMGraphics classes to the
 	com.bbn.openmap.omGraphics package.

	* The configure script now checks to see if you're using the Java
 	2 platform.  If so, it sets up the appropriate variables in the
 	Makefiles.

1999-02-02 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the com.bbn.openmap.layer.util.LayerUtils class, which
	provides a couple convenience functions for parsing properties for
	layers.

	* Created the coverage managers for DTED and RPF, which broke the
	data coverage generation functions out from the layer, so that a
	specialist could be made without duplicating a bunch of code.

1999-01-27 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Modified the DTED package to be able to produce indexed images
 	(images that use colormaps, as opposed to the direct colormodel).

	* Modified the RPF package to do the same thing.

	* Added methods to the OMRasterObject that let you add image
 	filters to manipulate the images when they are generated.

1999-01-21 Donald Dietrick <dietrick@bbn.com>

	* Added the Tool object in the gui package, reflecting a change in
 	how the ToolPanel is used.  The ToolPanel was also changed to
 	accept the addition of tools.  The old ToolPanel is now the
 	OMToolSet, and is added to the ToolPanel in the OpenMap
 	application.

	* Changed the setWidgets() function in OpenMap.java.  setWidgets
 	was the place to add customized derivations of the
 	MapBean,ToolPanel, InformationDelegator and MenuPanel to the
 	OpenMap application.  If an object wasn't added, a default was, and
 	the default widgets were connected with the assumptions they
 	should be.  Now, the interconnections should be made in
 	setWidgets().  If setWidgets is empty, a minimal functioning
 	version of OpenMap runs, without a ToolPanel or Gesturing.

1999-01-20  <culliney@bohemia>

	* (OLD) Changed all Swing package names from the old
 	`com.sun.java.swing' to the new `javax.swing'.  This will work
 	with the Java 2 platform or JDK1.1.X with Swing 1.1

	* Added SimpleMap examples which show how to use OpenMap for very
 	simple Map displays.

1999-01-15  <culliney@bohemia>

	* Spruced up the EarthquakeLayer.  It has a GUI palette, and now
 	responds to gestures: click on an earthquake to get more
 	information.  It also fetches its graphics in a SwingWorker thread
 	so it doesn't block the AWT thread.

	* Added methods to OMGraphicList to let you select all graphics,
 	and temporarily render all graphics in the list in their selected
 	state.  Can be used by lists serving as composite OMGraphics.

	* Added a getMapMouseListener() m ethod to the dted layer, since
 	the Layer default for this method had changed to null.

	* Added the test in LayerPane, LayerMenu, and OpenMap to make the
 	LayerPanel and Layer Palettes use JFrames (instead of
 	JInternalFrames) if running as an application.  If running as an
 	applet, do it the old way.

1999-01-06 Tom Mitchell <tmitchel@bbn.com>

	* Added box capability in OMText objects.  setShowBounds(boolean)
 	and getShowBounds() are the accessors for this functionality.

1999-01-05 Tom Mitchell <tmitchel@wolfjaw.bbn.com>

	* proj/Projection.java: added 'extends java.io.Serializable' per
	patches send by slee@bbn.com.  This enables the serialization of
	projections for storing map settings.  No testing has been done,
	so this should go in the category of "untested and unsupported".

1998-12-22 Tom Mitchell <tmitchel@wolfjaw.bbn.com>

	* gui/ToolPanel.java: Fixed a bug reported by slee@bbn.com.
	Apparently a cut/paste induced problem in removeZoomListener().

1998-12-16 Aaron Culliney <aculline@blatz.bbn.com>

	* Changed event/MapMouseListenerAdapter.java to
 	event/MapMouseAdapter.java to conform to the AWT/Event/Bean naming
 	convention.

1998-12-14 Tom Mitchell <tmitchel@bbn.com>

	* Converted to Swing 1.1.  OpenMap(tm) is now JDK 1.2 ready, but
	can still be used with JDK 1.1 by using the Swing 1.1 add-on
	package.

1998-12-11  <culliney@bohemia>

	* Added reference to www.opensource.org in the MapBean copyright
 	message.

	* Reformatted and improved comments in the files of the event/
 	subdirectory.

	* Fixed the toplevel configure.in and configure to use full
 	pathnames for java executables.

	* Added fixes to NavMouseMode for the mouseClicked() trickle-down,
 	and dateline problems.  In JDK1.1, mouseClicked() would get passed
 	down to components underneath the menu when making a selection.
 	This would cause the map to recenter in navigation mode.

1998-12-04  <culliney@bohemia>

	* Add a bunch of comments following this one on the work done in
 	various main classes and APIs over the past several months.

	* Removed support for LatLon ellipses in OMGraphics and Projection
 	because code was not being used, and was incorrect.  Need to
 	reimplement this functionality later.

	* Slimmed down the Projection.forwardPoly() method.  Removed the
 	`connect' variable.  If you want vertices connected, (polygons),
 	then you must do so yourself.  This requirement also transfers to
 	OMPoly, and is documented in the javadocs.

	* Removed older `specialist' layer code from the OpenMap tree
 	because it requires CORBA (maybe the Visibroker variant) to build.
 	Since we can't supply this to developers, it's not part of the
 	core.

	* Removed dependency on `OverlayTable'.  For the OpenMap viewer
 	application, Layers are now specified along with other variables
 	in the openmap.properties file.  It is easier to develop different
 	applications using the MapBean without this relic dependency.

	* OMGraphicList now derives from OMGraphic.  This means that you
 	can construct recursive lists and groupings of graphics.

1998-10-19  <culliney@bohemia>

	* added "nsges" parameter to OMGraphics and proj library.  Use
 	this to specify how many segments should be drawn between vertices
 	of your vector graphic (for circles, and rhumb/greatcircle lines).

1998-08-03  <culliney@bohemia>

	* Added constructors to OMPoly() that allow you to specify that
 	the float[] rawllpts are in reverse order.

	* Constructors for OMPoly and setLocation() methods that take a
 	float[] rawllpts value now convert the array IN PLACE to lat/lon
 	order RADIANS.  This is for more efficient use of the projection
 	code.  If you need to access the original float[] values, then you
 	should send in a copy.  This is FAST!

1998-07-24  <culliney@bohemia>

	* changed OMPoly.setLocation() functions to take a units value
 	since we allow both radians and decimal degrees (default) for
 	coordinate units.

1998-07-22  <culliney@bohemia>

	* Added an isPlotable() method to Projection.java.  This is meant
 	to be used before projecting and rendering point objects like
 	bitmaps.  In some projections (Orthographic), the forward() will
 	give you a valid point, but one that isn't on the visible
 	hemisphere, thus you should first check to see if isPlotable().
 	NOTE that you DO NOT need to do this check for non-point objects,
 	(lines, polys, etc), they get normalized/clipped correctly
 	already.

	* override getInsets() in the MapBean to return Insets(0,0,0,0).
 	This fixes a problem of drawing graphics at a +2 x/y offset
 	because of a Border around the Bean (added by OpenMap.java).  Note
 	that the border still gets drawn with this fix in place.

1998-07-16  <culliney@bohemia>

	* Added a drawBackground() function to the Projection classes.
 	The BufferedMapBean now delegates background rendering to the
 	current projection.

	* Removed WhoPanel.  The InformationDelegator now controls the
 	WhoLine screen real estate.  Anything that used WhoPanel should
 	use the InformationDelegator.
